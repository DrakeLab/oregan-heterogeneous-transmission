{Superspreading transmission is usually modeled using the negative binomial distribution, whose variance is larger than the mean. However, populations are often strictly partitioned into groups by behavioral, biological or environmental risk factors, particularly in closed settings, such as in workplaces and care homes. Models that include variation induced by population structure, together with infectiousness, are lacking. To address this need, we develop a mechanistic finite mixture model for the number of secondary infections that unites population partitioning with individual-level heterogeneity in infectious period duration. We show that the variance of the number of secondary infections is composed of both sources of heterogeneity: risk group structuring and infectiousness. We use the model to construct the outbreak size distribution, and to derive critical thresholds for elimination resulting from control activities that target the superspreading subpopulation and the entire population. We compare our model with the standard negative binomial distribution, and show that the tail behavior of the outbreak size distribution under a finite mixture model differs substantially. Our results indicate that even if the infectious period follows a bell-shaped distribution, heterogeneity in outbreak sizes may arise due to the influence of population risk structure. }

\section{Introduction}
Epidemic superspreading is a result of heterogeneity in disease transmission. Individuals vary in their ability to transmit infectious agents as a result of biological, behavioral or environmental factors \citep{Lloyd-Smith2005-ma,Funk2010-zj, Althouse2020-dn}. Superspreading events, where one infected individual gives rise to a large number of secondary infections in a single generation, may be the source of most of the secondary cases in a population \citep{Althouse2020-dn}. For example, the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was characterized by multiple superspreading events (e.g., \citep{Hamner2020-zt, Adam2020-xk, Lemieux2021-ow, Illingworth2021-rz}). Understanding the role of superspreading individuals in disease transmission is important to effective intervention. 

%should this be split into multiple paragraphs? e.g contact and behavior examples, biology, environment examples. environment may need to be expanded upon further.
% Opportunities for superspreading may arise from heterogeneous contact patterns.
\comment{
\marginnote{The argument seems out of sequence here. In the last paragraph you already said that individual variation gives rise to superspreading. Then you moved to superspreading events. Now we're back to heterogeneity again.} 


Individual variation in behavior, biology and environment can all induce superspreading transmission patterns. For example, \citet{Sneppen2021-mr} characterized contact heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, distinguishing between transmission occurring in social networks consisting of mostly regular contacts (e.g., individuals encountered on a daily basis such as those within a household) and transmission occurring in large contact networks consisting of individuals encountered infrequently (e.g., encounters in retail stores, bars and restaurants, or public transport). Their model suggests that individuals whose social network consists of high numbers of infrequently encountered individuals (e.g., retail workers) have a greater diversity of contacts and therefore greater propensity for superspreading than individuals with narrow social networks and few random contacts (e.g., remote workers). Biological factors that give rise to superspreading include heterogeneities in shedding or viral load \citep{Goyal2021-xr}, differences in transmission mode (e.g., aerosol vs. droplet transmission \citep{Chen2021-wo}), and variation in symptomatology (asymptomaticity/mild symptoms vs. severe symptoms \citep{ Illingworth2021-rz}). For example, shedding of aerosols may infect more people than droplets, as aerosols travel farther and remain suspended in the air for a longer period, in contrast with droplets that quickly fall to a surface. Visiting crowded, poorly ventilated environments where it is difficult to implement social distancing can also contribute to superspreading transmission, particularly if combined with biological factors (e.g., frequent coughing) or behavioral factors (e.g., mask usage). Some studies distinguish between heterogeneities in transmission that arise due to supershedding, which is due to biological factors, and superspreading, which arises primarily due to contact patterns \citep{Rock2014-nc}.

%In sum, the probability distribution of the number of secondary infections $N$ depends on just two microlevel processes: a contact process $\{K(x)\}$ leading to infections that each infectious individual independently follows and the infectious period cumulative distribution $F_I(x)$. We note that different specifications of these processes and mixtures can induce the same GW process with mean $R_0$ and offspring distribution of N at the macro-level (Yan 2008).



%%move this paragraph elsewhere?
%In theory for branching processes of epidemics, the probability distribution of the number of secondary infections per individual depends on just two microlevel processes: a contact process leading to infections that each infectious individual independently follows and the infectious period cumulative distribution function (Yan 2008). Firstly, the process describing the cumulative number of contacts leading to infection made by an infectious individual with susceptible individuals per unit time is specified (e.g., Mode and Sleeman 2000, Yan 2008). A Poisson contact process with intensity $\lambda q$ is typically assumed, where $\lambda$ is the expected number of contacts per unit time and $q$ is the probability of infection given contact. A Poisson process implies that the time between transmission contacts (exposures leading to infection) is exponentially distributed (Mode and Sleeman 2000, Yan 2008, Diekmann Heesterbeek and Britton 2013) and thus contacts with susceptibles are effectively random. Second, a model for the infectious period is specified. For example, in Crump-Mode-Jagers (CMJ) branching processes, the infectious period for each individual is a continuous random variable. Common assumptions for the infectious period distribution include the exponential distribution, and the gamma distribution. An exponentially distributed infectious period implies that the majority of cases recover rapidly from infection. In contrast, a gamma distribution can be parameterized to have a central tendency, which more realistically describes the distribution of the infectious period for many diseases (Keeling and Rohani 2008). Mixing the Poisson contact process with the distribution of the infectious period yields a mixture distribution that describes the number of offspring (cases) per generation (Mode and Sleeman 2000, Yan 2008, Diekmann Heesterbeek and Britton 2013). Conveniently, CMJ processes have an embedded discrete-time Galton-Watson (GW) process that tracks the number of offspring per generation and governs outbreak threshold behavior \citep{Mode2000-hp}. Typically researchers simulate the number of secondary infections per individual in discrete time using an offspring distribution arising from a GW process (e.g., \citep{Lloyd-Smith2005-ma, Kucharski2015-lh, Endo2020-td, Hellewell2020-go}). Additionally, the theory of GW processes offers many analytical and computational advantages. The total number of cases arising from a single infected individual (i.e., a transmission chain) can be simulated easily, the probability of a large outbreak can be calculated and the distribution of transmission chains that go extinct can often be obtained (e.g., \citep{Blumberg2013-xv}).

%Long-tailed secondary infection distributions induce greater variability in outbreak size, which can be characterized by larger probability of observing no secondary infections, smaller probability of major epidemics, larger coefficient of variation in the number of secondary infections and greater probabilities of observing a chain smaller than a given size than for Poisson epidemics \citep{Althouse2020-dn}.

%The negative binomial distribution is the most commonly used offspring distribution for modeling superspreading events. Typically the micro-level assumptions of its underlying CMJ process are a Poisson contact process and a gamma-distributed infectious period, with the resulting mixture distribution being negative binomial e.g., \citep{Lloyd-Smith2005-ma}.

%Different microscale processes can yield the same macroscale process describiing outbreaks (e.g. Gaske, Yan, 
%maybe say could be due to heterogeneity in infection duration, or average reproductive number
 
A simple and commonly used model for superspreading transmission is the negative binomial distribution for the number of secondary infections per infectious individual. The negative binomial distribution can be parameterized using a mean ($R_0$) and dispersion parameter ($k$). If $k$ is small, the distribution is long-tailed and its variance is greater than the mean, a property that cannot be captured using the Poisson distribution. Long-tailed secondary infection distributions induce greater variability in outbreak sizes, larger probability of observing no secondary infections, smaller probability of major epidemics and greater probabilities of observing a transmission chain smaller than a given size compared with Poisson epidemics \citep{Althouse2020-dn}. Using a negative binomial branching process allows 
the total number of cases arising from a single infected individual (i.e., a transmission chain) to be readily simulated, and analytical results from branching process theory yield the probability of a large outbreak \citep{Mode2000-hp} and the distribution of transmission chains (minor outbreaks) that go extinct (e.g., \citep{Blumberg2013-xv}).  However, heterogeneous transmission is often characterized by the host population being partitioned into two or more groups, e.g., by social, biological, behavioral or environmental risk structure \citep{Keeling2008-sh, Rock2014-nc}. Examples of settings with strict population partitions include workplaces (e.g., a meat processing facility with workers on the floor and office workers sharing a public space such as a cafeteria where mixing of both groups occurs, schools with classroom bubbles (teachers may have lots of contacts because they teach numerous classroom groups whereas students may only contact nearest neighbours in a socially distanced classroom) or binary partitioning of a closed population according to a categorical variable that affects susceptibility or infectiousness (for example, characterizing patients in a care home by vaccination status).  The characteristics of the population partitions affect the distribution of secondary infections per infected individual. For example, an important aspect of population heterogeneity that is not accounted for in the standard negative binomial model is the partitioning of the population by average contact rate. Heterogeneity can arise if a portion of the population have high levels of random mixing \citep{Sneppen2021-mr}, engage in risky behavior (e.g., reporting to work when symptomatic or refusing to wear a mask in crowded environments), or exhibit disproportionate shedding \citep{Goyal2021-xr}.  Models for the distribution of secondary infections that combine population risk structure with realistic distributions of infection duration are currently lacking.
 
Here we present a new family of mathematical models for superspreading based on finite mixture theory. We study the effect of simply structured populations by dividing the population into two groups that are characterized by different contact rates, i.e., two Poisson processes with different intensities. A proportion $p$ of the population is characterized by a high ("superspreading") transmission rate, and the remainder $1-p$ have a lower ("regular") transmission rate. Dividing the population into subpopulations with different transmission rates gives rise to a contact process described by a finite mixture of two Poisson distributions. A finite mixture of negative binomial distributions with the same dispersion parameter $k$ arises from mixing the Poisson finite mixture with a gamma distribution for the infectious period with coefficient of variation $1/\sqrt{k}$. \comment{Then a finite mixture of geometric distributions (i.e.,with $k=1$) and a finite mixture of Poisson distributions (with $k\rightarrow \infty$) arise as special cases.\footnote{Unclear if these are three separate models -- mixed Poisson, mixed NB, and mixed geometric -- or different versions of the same thing. I think some transition language linking the three sentences would be helpful. SO: Hopefully this has been made more clear.}

}To study the effect of population structure on the stochastic characteristics of transmission at the beginning of an outbreak, we calculate the mean and variance of the secondary infection distributions, use generating functions to calculate the probability of a major epidemic when $R_0>1$, and we derive the transmission chain size distributions conditioned on extinction. To understand how these key statistics differ from those generated by models without population structure, we compare the statistics obtained from the mixture distributions with those generated by a negative binomial distribution with the same mean and dispersion parameter. 

To examine the implications of population structure for containment, we study the effect of decreasing $R_0$ in three ways. First we alter the heterogeneous structure of the population by examining the effect of varying the proportion of superspreaders $p$. We represent a reduction in the proportion of individuals with high transmission rate by decreasing the proportion $p$ of the population that do not comply with protective policies such as stay-at-home orders or face covering mandates, do not self-isolate when sick, or exhibit high shedding. Next, to model the effect of individual behaviors such as self-isolating when symptomatic, we decrease the average number of additional successful contacts per generation in the superspreading group \footnote{``superspreading cohort'' has not yet been defined. Perhaps it makes sense to first desginate one of the two groups as the superspreaders and then define $p$ wrt the relative frequency of this class in the population. SO: Done.} while keeping it fixed in the remainder, which may be viewed as decreasing their intensity of interactions \footnote{Need a linking phrase saying why we did this -- what is the rationale? SO: Done.}. Third, to model a control action that is applied to the entire population, we decrease baseline transmission rate in both groups simultaneously, e.g., both groups wear face coverings\footnote{Again, rationale is needed SO: done}. Our work shows that the mechanistic addition of population structure induces qualitatively different outbreak patterns compared with the negative binomial superspreading model. We show that the critical threshold for containment is different and depends on whether only superspreaders are targeted vs whether both groups are targeted. Which of these strategies is the most effective is context-dependent. 

%We study three finite mixtures: a model with transmission heterogeneity only (a finite mixture of two Poisson distributions) and two models with heterogeneities in transmission patterns and infection duration (finite mixtures of two negative binomial distributions and two geometric distributions).

%do they have the same variance? I think not, because p varies. The bit that is different is G''(N)

%In summary, our key questions are:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Does the mechanistic addition of population structure induce qualitatively different outbreak patterns from a standard negative binomial superspreading model with mean $R_0$ and dispersion parameter $k$ assuming $R_0>1$? 
%\item How does decreasing the level of superspreading by a) changing the population structure e.g., by shifting the contact structure away from opportunistic encounters/aerosol transmission and towards regular contacts/direct contact transmission, and b) decreasing the average number of successful contacts in the superspreading cohort affect heterogeneity in outbreak patterns, and what are the implications for containment?

%also standard superspreading model can be derived by assuming a Poisson contact process, gamma distributed infectious period and their mixture is negative binomial. 
%I don't want to be heavily critical of the model either. just want to examine how exactly superspreading arises, and deriving a more mechanistic model. 
%which arises from mixing gamma distributed infectious period with constant contact rate per infectious individual.
We begin by reviewing the derivation of the superspreading model in \citet{Lloyd-Smith2005-ma} and its underlying micro-level processes. 
First, each individual has an expected reproduction number, which is the theoretical average number of secondary infections that would be generated over the course of their infectious period if repeated infections could be observed. This individual-based expected reproduction number is represented by the random variable $\nu$. Individual variation in infectiousness is modeled by letting $\nu$ be gamma-distributed with mean $R_0$ and dispersion $k$. Second, to account for demographic stochasticity in disease transmission, the realized number of secondary cases is assumed to be Poisson distributed with mean $\nu$. Integrating over all possible individual reproduction numbers yields a negative binomial model with mean $R_0$ and dispersion parameter $k$. We note that different micro-scale continuous processes can induce the same discrete time process at the macro-level that describes the distribution of outbreaks \citep{Mode2000-hp, Garske2008-ax, Yan2008-jc}. For example, if we assume that each infected individual follows a Poisson contact process with mean $\beta x$, and that each individual has a gamma-distributed infectious period $x$ with mean $1/\gamma$ and coefficient of variation $1/\sqrt{k}$, then the mixture of these distributions is negative binomial with mean $R_0 = \beta/\gamma$ and dispersion parameter $k$ (e.g., \citep{Mode2000-hp, Diekmann2013-zu, Yan2008-jc}). Both of these formulations of the standard model for superspreading are Poisson mixtures \citep{Karlis2005-az}, and  heterogeneity in secondary infections is caused by overdispersion in infectiousness. In both models, if $k$ is close to zero, then the duration of infectiousness is right-skewed with most individuals generating 0 or 1 secondary infections. This can be interpreted as a majority of the population exhibiting short infectious period. However, because the infectious period distribution has a long right-hand-tail for $k<<1$, some individuals remain infected for long times, and therefore infect many individuals over the course of their infectious period, giving rise to superspreading events. In Table \ref{tab:standardstats} we list the probability mass function, probability generating function and the statistics obtained from the negative binomial model that we use in this paper. 

 The standard negative binomial model does not capture heterogeneity in population structure that could additionally induce superspreading, such as processes that divide the population into distinct risk groups. In what follows, we examine the micro-level processes that induce superspreading transmission, and  use them to derive a more mechanistic model. 

%We want to be more specific in how we specify risk structure

%We note that different micro-scale CMJ processes can induce the same GW process at the macro-level (Yan 2008). %Different mixtures of contact processes with the distribution of the infectious period can yield the same probability distribution for the number of secondary infections and same $R_0$.

%moreover the standard model assumes that the superspreading comes from the gamma distributed infectious period only and the mixing with poisson is due to the coarse assumption of demographic stochasticity (in what?) or it comes from individual reproduction numbers that are gamma distributed. and what is an individual reproduction number? individual contact rate * individual inf period.

%mechanistic derivation? the standard model for superspreading is the negative binomial with mean R0 and dispersion k. There are a couple of things I can see. For example Lloyd Smith et al used a neg binom model for superspreading by arguing that individual reproductive numbers were gamma distributed with mean R0 and dispersion parameter k and demographic stochasticity was Poisson distributed. The resulting Poisson-gamma mixture distribution is a negative binomial. On the other hand, a negative binomial can be derived by gamma distributed infectious period with mean 1/gamma and CV 1/k and Poisson contact process with intesnity beta. That model would have the superspreading component captured by the dispersion parameter - disadvangtage since it suggests

%want to also argue our model gives rise to a gW branching process that wesimulate

\subsection{A mechanistic model of superspreading}

Here, we develop a branching process model that combines both discrete and continuous sources of heterogeneity. Specifically, we study a Crump-Mode-Jagers (CMJ) continuous-time branching process that accounts for micro-level transmission. Following \citet{Yan2008-jc}, at the micro-scale, the CMJ process assumes that infectious individuals have independently and identically distributed infectious period (generation time), in which individuals produce secondary infections according to a contact process $\{K(x)\}$. The generation time and contact processes are independent, and at the end of the generation time, the infectious individual produces a random number $N$ of secondary infections. \footnote{Doesn't it make more sense to say the CMJ processes is embedded in a GW process? Not sure I understand your argument here. If my understanding is correct, could you say ``Embedding the CMJ branching process there is a macro-level discrete-time Galton-Watson...'' SO: Hopefully the following edit makes sense.}Scaling up from continuous time at the micro-level to the macro-level of discrete generation times allows us to describe the production of secondary infections as a macro-level discrete-time Galton-Watson (GW) branching process  \citep{Mode2000-hp, Yan2008-jc}. This has the major advantage of being able to use GW branching process theory to obtain key statistics such as the basic reproduction number, i.e., the mean value of the GW process $R_0=E[N]$ and the probability of stochastic extinction \citep{Mode2000-hp, Yan2008-jc}.

%different microlevel processes can lead to superspreading at the macrolevel. %To model superspreading, we need to consider what happens on the microlevel

 %[High level overview of modeling approach]
 
 %should i define microlevel processes before this paragraph? 
\footnote{I wonder if we need a concetual figure (and associated simulations?) to illustrate the basic idea. Eric could help. }We distinguish between superspreading and regular transmission  by infectious individuals.  Micro-level behavioral, biological and environmental processes may all underpin heterogeneous transmission in a population. Biological factors that give rise to superspreading include heterogeneities in shedding or viral load \citep{Goyal2021-xr}, differences in transmission mode (e.g., aerosol vs. droplet transmission \citep{Chen2021-wo}), and variation in symptomatology (asymptomaticity/mild symptoms vs. severe symptoms \citep{ Illingworth2021-rz}). For example, shedding of aerosols may infect more people than droplets, as aerosols travel farther and remain suspended in the air for a longer period, in contrast with droplets that quickly fall to a surface. Behavioral factors that contribute to superspreading include not complying with self-isolation or quarantine protocols. Environmental factors that contribute to superspreading transmission include frequenting crowded, poorly ventilated environments where it is difficult to implement social distancing, particularly if combined with biological factors (e.g., symptoms that help spread infection such as coughing) or behavioral factors (e.g., non-compliance with mask mandates). Social and environmental factors also include heterogeneities in contact patterns that affect proximity to susceptible individuals, for example,  working in a environment whereby many different contacts are made per day (e.g. a teacher or a retail worker). Our modeling approach combines two sources of heterogeneity: the partitioning of the population into risk groups (e.g., by occupation) and continuous processes (e.g., the infectious period or symptoms that correlate with the duration of infectiousness).

To account for population risk structure, we begin by dividing the population into two disjoint classes: a fraction $p$ belonging to a superspreading group and the remainder $1-p$ are members of a regular group. We assume the two groups contact others according to Poisson processes with different intensities, with the superspreading group having a higher average successful contact rate over a time interval of length $x$ where they spread infection to susceptible individuals than the regular group. Noting that if number of transmissions given contact is a binomial random variable with probability $q$ and the contact process is Poisson distributed with rate $\tilde{c} x$, then the number of transmissions is Poisson distributed with the average contact intensity leading to transmission being the product of the average contact rate and the probability of transmission given contact over a time interval of length $x$ \citep{Diekmann2013-zu}. We denote this product by $\tilde{c} q x = \beta x$ in the regular group. Similarly, in the superspreading group, we assume the number of regular contacts per individual is Poisson distributed with rate $\beta x$ and the number of additional contacts per individual is Poisson distributed with rate $\tilde{\delta} x$. Then the number of contacts made per individual in the superspreading group is the sum of these two independent random variables, and it is Poisson distributed with rate
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:R0Adel}
   \beta^S x= \beta x +\tilde{\delta} x, \quad \tilde{\delta} >0.  
\end{equation}
Letting $C$ be a random variable denoting the cumulative number of infectious contacts (contact with susceptible individuals that lead to infection) by time $x$,  a finite mixture of Poisson distributions with probability mass function %strictly speaking this is lambda q and lambda^s q, with q binomial (either infected or not). mixture of Poisson and binomial is Poisson (Heesterbeek 2013)
%this pmf is the pmf conditional on the value of x. 
%advantage of mode and sleeman approach is that it makes the connection with embedded GW process explicit. easier to argue we simulate by generation time. 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:contactpmf}
  P(C=c)=  p \frac{(\beta^S x)^c}{c!} e^{-\beta^S x} +(1-p)\frac{(\beta x)^c }{c!} e^{-\beta x}
\end{equation}
and probability generating function
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:contactpgf}
    G(s,x) = p \exp \left ( \beta^S x (s-1) \right)  + (1-p) \exp  \left (\beta x (s-1)\right), \quad s \in [0,1]
\end{equation}
describes the stochastic contact process $\{C(x): x \in [0, \infty)\}$ in the population. The contact process is a counting process that stops when the infectious period of an infectious individual terminates. The stopping time is defined by the length of the infectious period $T_I$, itself a random variable.

To account for heterogeneity in the duration of infectiousness, following \citet{Anderson1980-vq} and  \citet{Britton2009-tt}, we assume the infectious period of both groups is gamma-distributed with mean $1/\gamma$ and coefficient of variation $1/\sqrt{k}$ with probability density function
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:gammapdf}
f_I(x) = \frac{(\gamma k)^k}{\Gamma(k)} x^{k-1}e^{-k \gamma x}
\end{equation}
and cumulative distribution function $P(T_I \leq x) = \int_0^x f_I(x) dx$. Here $k$ is a positive real number and $\Gamma(k)$ denotes the gamma function. The gamma distribution is flexible and allows for long-tailed right-skewed distributions (i.e., $k<1$), and bell-shaped distributions ($k>1$) that become more symmetric as $k$ increases. If $k=1$, the distribution reduces to the exponential distribution. Infectious period distributions that have symmetry about the mean are often more realistic for modeling infectious periods \citep{Lloyd2001-eq, Wearing2005-oo, Keeling2008-sh} than right-skewed distributions, which assume that most individuals have recovery times that are much shorter than the mean. However, strongly right-skewed distributions (i.e., $k<<1$) capture the property of there being a small proportion of individuals in the population with extremely long infectious period, who could therefore make many contacts leading to transmission over the course of being infected.

%here we make the argument that derives the probability generating function for the number of secondary infections. 
%should I put in the argument where N(x) = K(x) x<Ti, K(T_I) x>= T_i for fixed x the number of secondary infections is G_N(s,x)
To find the probability distribution for the cumulative number of transmission contacts generated by an infectious individual throughout its entire infectious period (i.e., the number of secondary infections per infectious individual per generation $N = 0, 1,2, \dots$) following \citet{Mode2000-hp} and \citet{Yan2008-jc}, the expression for the probability generating function is
\begin{align}\label{eqn:mixturepgf}
    G_N(s) &= \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} s^j P(N=j) \notag \\ &= \int_0^{\infty} G(s,x) f_I(x) dx \notag \\ &= \int_0^\infty \left (p e^{\beta^S x (s-1)}+(1-p)e^{\beta x (s-1)} \right) \frac{(\gamma k)^k}{\Gamma(k)} x^{k-1}e^{-k \gamma x} dx.
\end{align}

Equation \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpgf} describes the macro-level Galton-Watson discrete-time branching process, in which the micro-scale continuous-time Crump-Mode-Jagers branching process is embedded  \citep{Mode2000-hp,Garske2008-ax, Yan2008-jc}. In Sections 2.3-2.7, we use equation \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpgf} to obtain statistics that describe the stochastic characteristics of outbreaks at the macro-level (e.g., \citep{Mode2000-hp,Garske2008-ax, Yan2008-jc}.
%We note that different micro-scale CMJ processes can induce the same GW process at the macro-level (Yan 2008). %Different mixtures of contact processes with the distribution of the infectious period can yield the same probability distribution for the number of secondary infections and same $R_0$. 

Denoting the average number of secondary infections over the course of the infectious period in the superspreading and regular groups respectively by $R_0^S$ and $R_0^R$, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the mixture branching process \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpgf}, i.e., the mean number of secondary infections per infectious individual per generation, is  
%\beta^S p k (\gamma k)^k (\gamma k + \beta^S(1-s))^{-k-1} + \beta (1-p) k (\gamma k)^k (\gamma k + \beta (1-s))^{-k-1}
%\beta^S p k (\gamma k)^k (\gamma k )^{-k-1} + \beta (1-p) k (\gamma k)^k (\gamma k )^{-k-1}
%\beta^S p k (\gamma k )^{-1} + \beta (1-p) k  (\gamma k )^{-1}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:R0}
   R_0= G_N'(1) = p\frac{ \beta^S }{\gamma } +(1-p)\frac{ \beta }  {\gamma  } = p R_0^S + (1-p) R_0^R.%\frac{p(\gamma k)^k}{(\gamma k + \beta^S(1-s))^k} +   \frac{(1-p)(\gamma k)^k}{(\gamma k + \beta(1-s))^k}.
\end{equation}

Evaluating $\frac{1}{j!} \frac{d^j}{ds^j} G_N(0) |_{s=0}$ $j=0,1,2\dots$ yields the probability mass function for the number of secondary infections per infectious individual with parameters $p$, $k$, $R_0^S$ and $R_0^R$,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:nbinommixpmf}
    P(N=j) = p_j = \frac{\Gamma(j+k)}{j! \Gamma (k)} \left [ p \left(\frac{k}{k+R_0^S} \right)^{k}\left (\frac{R_0^S}{k+R_0^S} \right )^j+ (1-p) \left(\frac{k}{k+R_0^R} \right)^{k}\left (\frac{R_0^R}{k+R_0^R} \right )^j \right ].
\end{equation}
%%this could be done via generating functions or the pdfs themselves. 
%say this is a finite mixture of negative binomials
Equation \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf} is a finite mixture of negative binomial distributions that combines regular transmission and superspreading. A finite mixture of geometric distributions (i.e., with $k=1$) and a finite mixture of Poisson distributions (with $k\rightarrow \infty$) arise as special cases. %together with a realistic distribution for the infectious period
The model is flexible in that it allows for a variety of infectious histories including having extremely high risk of superspreading transmission to others (e.g., high average contact rate and long infectious period), high risk of superspreading transmission to others (e.g., high contact rate and fast recovery rate), moderate risk of being a superspreader (e.g., low average contact rate and long infectious period) and being characterized by regular transmission (e.g., low contact rate and fast recovery rate). Therefore, model \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf} for the offspring distribution more accurately captures a spectrum of individual infection histories than the standard negative binomial model with mean $R_0$ and dispersion parameter $k$. 

%To examine the influence of having two contact processes with different intensities in the mixture model compared with having just one on the probability distribution, we compare the probability mass functions of the the mixture model \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf} with the standard model with same $R_0$ and dispersion parameter $k$ in Figure \ref{fig:pmf}. The probability of an infectious individual producing no secondary infections ($P(N=0)$) is higher in the mixture models than the base model for all values of $k$. As $k$ increases, the level of heterogeneity declines in that $P(N=0)$ declines in both models, but the standard model has a greater central tendency than the mixture model. In sum, there are visible differences in the probability mass functions of both models, and we conclude that having a mixture of two contact processes substantially affects the probability mass function. 

%Even though the evolution of an epidemic in continuous time may be
%accounted for in a one-type CMJ-process, all such processes have a
%discrete time BGW-process embedded in them.

\subsection{Mean and variance of the finite  negative binomial mixture process} %does this need a subsection
%[overview]
%need to define R0 in terms of p and delta. 
To study the statistical characteristics of this model and to enable its comparison with the standard model (Table \ref{tab:standardstats}), we calculate its mean and variance.  Noting that $R_0^R = \beta/\gamma$,  we can rewrite $R_0^S$ in terms of $R_0^R$,
\begin{equation}
R_0^S = \frac{\beta + \tilde{\delta}}{\gamma} = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} + \frac{ \tilde{\delta}}{\gamma} = R_0^R + \delta, 
\end{equation}
where $\delta =\tilde{\delta}/\gamma$ is the average number of additional contacts over the course of the average infectious period.  Rewriting the basic reproduction number \eqref{eqn:R0} of the mixture model  in terms of $\delta$, the expression for the average number of secondary infections simplifies to $R_0 = R_0^R + p \delta$, which lies between $R_0^R$ and $R_0^S$ if $0<p<1$. 
% do I need formal definition of R0?

To understand the behavior of the variance of the offspring distribution \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf}, first, we calculate the variance of the Poisson mixture model (i.e., as $k \rightarrow \infty$). Returning to the infectious contact process derivation, if the infectious period is constant and equal to $1/\gamma$, then the number of infectious contacts is Poisson distributed with a rate that follows a discrete distribution that models the two risk groups, specifically, the average contact rate $\bar{\beta}$ is either equal to $\beta^S/\gamma=R_0^S$ with probability $p$, or equal to $\beta/\gamma=R_0^R$ with probability $1-p$. This discrete distribution for the risk groups is the mixing distribution \citep{Karlis2005-az} and its mean is $R_0 = p R_0^S + (1-p) R_0^R$. The variance of the mixing distribution is 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mixingvar}
  V(\bar{\beta})  = \sum (\bar{\beta} - R_0)^2 P(\bar{\beta}) =  (R_0^S - R_0)^2 p + (1-p)(R_0^R - R_0)^2 = p(1-p)(R_0^S - R_0^R)^2 = p(1-p)\delta^2. 
\end{equation}
Then it can be shown that the variance of the finite Poisson mixture is  given by \citep{Karlis2005-az}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Poissonvar}
  V(N)  = E(\bar{\beta}) + V(\bar{\beta}) = R_0 + p(1-p)\delta^2, 
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eqn:Poissonvar} shows that if a closed population consists of a superspreading subpopulation and a subpopulation with regular transmission, then the number of secondary cases per infectious individual is overdispersed, even if everybody in the population has the same infectious period. Specifically, equation \eqref{eqn:Poissonvar} shows that the variance of the Poisson mixture is equal to the sum of the variance of the Poisson process and the variance of the mixing distribution, which in this case is a finite discrete distribution where the average contact rate can take two values according to the proportions of the risk groups in the population. Clearly, the variance increases with the number of contacts made by the superspreading subpopulation, and it is a quadratic function of the proportion of superspreaders, attaining its maximum at $1/2 + 1/2 \delta$. The variance is an increasing function of $p$ provided superspreaders are a minority of the population (i.e., $0\leq p \leq 1/2$).

%%this is the key result of the paper. 
Now, with some algebra, the variance $V(N)$ of the number of secondary infections in the mixture model \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf} may be obtained from the probability generating function, which yields
\begin{align}\label{eqn:variance}
V(N) &= G_N''(1) + G_N'(1) -  (G_N'(1))^2 \notag \\ &= \frac{k+1}{k} \left (p (R_0^S)^2 + (1-p) (R_0^R)^2  \right ) +R_0(1-R_0) \notag\\ &=  \underbrace{R_0}_{\text{Poisson process}}+ \underbrace{p(1-p)\delta^2}_{\text{Risk group process}} +\underbrace{\frac{1}{k} \left[ p (R_0^S)^2 + (1-p)(R_0^R)^2 \right]}_{\text{Infectious period process}}. 
\end{align}
Therefore, equation \eqref{eqn:variance} shows that the variance is equal to that of the finite Poisson mixture in \eqref{eqn:Poissonvar} and an additional factor that results from the infectious period also being a random variable. The variance of the finite negative binomial mixture is overdispersed, with the overdispersion driven by the influence of the  disjoint subpopulations, and the variability of the infectious period per individual.  Equation \eqref{eqn:variance} suggests that even if the infectious period distribution has low coefficient of variation (i.e., $k>1$), heterogeneity in secondary infections will still be apparent due to the overdispersion arising from the population being divided into risk groups. We also note that greater disparities between the variance of the finite negative binomial mixture and the variance of the standard model are expected if the superspreading group contributes strongly to overall transmission, e.g., through a large difference between $R_0^R$ and $R_0^S$  that induces $R_0>1$, as opposed to $R_0<1$ (in this instance, $\delta$ is usually small). 

Equation \eqref{eqn:variance} can also be written as
\begin{equation*}
    V(N) = p(1-p)(R_0^S - R_0^R)^2 + p \left (R_0^S + \frac{(R_0^S)^2}{k} \right ) + (1-p) \left (R_0^R + \frac{(R_0^R)^2}{k} \right ),
\end{equation*}
which can be viewed as the sum of the variance of the finite mixture risk group process, and the weighted sum of the variance of negative binomial processes with means $R_0^S$ and $R_0^R$ respectively and same dispersion parameter $k$. If $p=0$, the variance of the mixture is simply the variance of the standard negative binomial model with mean $R_0^R$, i.e., $V(N) = R_0^R + (R_0^R)^2/k$, and similarly, if $p=1$, equation \eqref{eqn:variance} becomes the variance of the standard negative binomial model with mean $R_0^S$. Therefore, equation \eqref{eqn:variance} lies between these two extremes if $0<p<1$. Like equation \eqref{eqn:Poissonvar}, the variance of the negative binomial mixture is an increasing function of the average number of additional contacts $\delta$, provided $0<p<1$, and it is also increasing if superspreaders are a minority of the population (the maximum with respect to $p$ is greater than 1/2). 


Comparing equation \eqref{eqn:variance} to the variance of the standard model, $R_0+R_0^2/k$, we see that the variance of the mixture model is greater than the variance of the standard model with a magnitude that depends on the two additional parameters $p$ and $\delta$. The more  contacts made per individual in the superspreading group, the higher the variance, and the greater the difference between the mixture and the standard model. We also note that for both models, the variance increases as the dispersion parameter $k\rightarrow 0$.

In sum,  the overdispersion of the finite negative binomial mixture model is driven by either the number of additional contacts made by the superspreading group, the fraction of superspreaders in the population, and/or the coefficient of variation of the infectious period. Consequently, variation in outbreak size \footnote{Not sure what ``outbreak heterogeneity'' is. Is is the same as ``variation in outbreak size''? SO: Yes. Replaced.} is expected to be highest for large $\delta$, small $p$, and small $k$.  %because the difference between $[ p (R_0^S)^2 + (1-p)(R_0^R)^2 ]$ and $R_0^2$ is $p(1-p)\delta^2$. 

%R_0^R + \frac{(R_0^R)^2}{k} + p \delta \left [ 1+ \delta(1-p) + \frac{2 R_0^R + \delta}{k} \right ]
%Heesterbeek: when during a time interval of length deltaT contacts are made according to a Poisson process with rate c, the number of contacts follows the Poisson distribution with mean parameter c deltaT. When contacts lead to successful transmission the number of 'successful' contacts is again Poisson distributed with mean parameter p c deltaT.

%mathematical derivation of model, including integrating over infectious period, and dividing to express things in terms of individual R0

 %We assume the number of successful contacts per individual per unit time leading to transmission over the course of their infectious period is Poisson distributed. However the number of transmission events per individual depends on whether they have low contact rate (i.e, close contact transmission) or high contact rate (i.e,  superspreading or aerosol transmission) . We assume $p$\% of transmission events occur through close contact, and $(1-p)$\% of transmission events occur via superspreading.

\subsection{Probability of extinction if $R_0>1$}
To calculate the probability of the mixture branching process becoming extinct, we numerically solve the following equation for the smallest root $s^*$, 
\begin{equation}
      s = G_N(s) =  \frac{p}{(1 + \frac{R_0^S}{k}(1-s))^k} +   \frac{(1-p)}{(1 + \frac{R_0^R}{k}(1-s))^k}. 
\end{equation}
When $R_0<1$, then $s^* = 1$ and a major outbreak cannot occur. If $R_0>1$, either there is a small outbreak that dies out with probability $s^*$ or the number of cases increases exponentially, becoming a major outbreak with probability $1-s^*$. If there is a small outbreak, the observed branching process will be the same as that arising from a different reproduction number \citep{Yan2008-jc}, 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:R0star}
    R_0^* = G_N'(s^*)<1.

\subsection{Calculating the chain size distribution}

%defn of chain
%To quantify transmission chains, we need the chain size distribution.
A transmission chain is the total number of cases that arise from a single index case in an outbreak that goes extinct. Chain size (outbreak size) distributions that describe the total number of cases arising from separate introductions are often available during outbreaks.  To obtain the chain size distribution, we follow the method in \citet{Blumberg2013-xv}, which relies upon the derivatives of powers of the generating function \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpgf}. We summarize their derivation of the formula for the chain size distribution below. 

%we are assuming each outbreak is started by a single index case.

For every transmission chain of size $y$ there are $y$ individuals that cause $y-1$ infections. For example, assuming the number of secondary infections per infectious individual $i=1,2,3\dots$ is a non-negative integer random variable $A_i$, then for a chain size of 1, the index case gives rise to no secondary infections, and $\{A_1\} = \{ 0\}$. In what follows, ordered elements will be enclosed in round brackets, and unordered elements will be enclosed in curly braces. For an outbreak with two cases, the first individual (i.e., the index case) gives rise to one secondary infection and the second infected individual does not infect anyone. Then the ordered sequence of secondary infections per infected individual comprising the chain is $(A_1, A_2) = (1, 0)$. For a chain size of three, the index case gives rise to either one infection or two infections. The sequence of secondary infections either follows $(A_1,  \{A_2, A_3\}) =( 2, \{0, 0\})$ or $(A_1, A_2, A_3) = (1, 1, 0)$. Figure \ref{fig:chainsdiagram} shows all the possible ways of how outbreaks with a total of up to 5 cases can arise.  
%put sum into separate lines
%reference??

Now the probability generating function $Q(s)$ for the sum of $y$ independent and identically distributed non-negative integer random variables $A_i$ with the same probability generating function $G(s) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty p_j s^j$, where $p_j = P(A_i = j)$, is 
$$Q(s) = (G(s))^y.$$
The probability that $y$ random variables $A_i$ sum up to $y-1$ is the coefficient of $s^{y-1}$ of $Q(s)$. To obtain the transmission chain of size $y$ we need the $(y-1)^{th}$ coefficient of $Q(s)$, but the coefficient is not the same as the probability of a chain having size $y$, because as shown in Figure \ref{fig:chainsdiagram}, the order of the infections matter. For example, for a chain size of 2, we require the coefficient of $s$ in the probability generating function $(G(s))^2 = (\sum_{i=0}^\infty p_j s^j)^2$, which is $2 p_1 p_0$\footnote{Have we defined $p_0$, $p_1$, etc.? Related, how are these related to the $P_0$, $P_1$, etc. in Figure 1? SO: Defined. Notation in Fig 1 corrected}. These probabilities correspond to two possible sequences that sum up to 1: $(A_1 ,A_2) = (1, 0)$ and $(A_1', A_2') = (0 ,1)$. For an outbreak of size 2, only the former is an admissible sequence of secondary infections, and we note that the latter inadmissible sequence is a cyclic permutation of the first. Therefore, to obtain the probability of a chain size of 2, we need to divide $2 p_1 p_0$ by 2. Similarly, for a chain size of 3, we need the $s^2$ coefficient  of $(G(s))^3$, which is $3p_2 p_0 + 3 p_1^2 p_0$, which we divide by 3 to find the probability of a chain size of 3.  This holds generally: out of the cyclic permutations of a non-negative sequence $(A_1, A_2,\dots,A_y)$ with $\sum_{i=1}^y A_i = y-1$, only one will be a valid transmission sequence (Theorem 1 in the supplement of \citet{Blumberg2013-xv}). Therefore we need to divide $(G(s))^y$ by $y$. In sum, to find the probability of a chain size of $y$, we find the $(y-1)^{th}$ coefficient of $(G(s))^{y-1}/y $. The $(y-1)^{th}$ coefficient is found by calculating the $(y-1)^{th}$ derivative  of $(G(s))^{y-1}/y $  and evaluating it at $s=0$.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:f}
    f^{(n)}= \frac{y!}{(y-n)!} [G(s)]^{y-n}  \Bigr|_{s=0}.
\end{equation}
According to Faa di Bruno's formula \citep{Johnson2002-nq}, the $(y-1)^{th}$ derivative of $Q(s)$ evaluated at $s=0$ is
%give standard form first, then sum up in terms of Bell polys
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fdb}
    \frac{d^{y-1} Q(s)}{ds^{y-1}} \Bigr|_{s=0} = \sum  f^{(n)} \frac{(y-1)!}{m_1! m_2! \dots m_{y-1}!} \left ( \frac{g'}{1!}\right )^{m_1} \left ( \frac{g''}{2!} \right )^{m_2}\dots \left ( \frac{g^{(y-1)}}{(y-1)!} \right )^{m_{y-1}}
\end{equation}
where the sum is over different solutions in non-negative integers $m_1, m_2, \dots, m_{y-1}$ of
\begin{align*}
    1. m_1 + 2. m_2 + \dots + (y-1) m_{y-1} &= y-1,\\
     m_1 + m_2 + \dots + m_{y-1} &= n.
\end{align*}
\footnote{Why the periods in the equation? SO: Because there are y-1 integers in the equation. }Equation \eqref{eqn:fdb} can be more succinctly written in terms of exponential Bell polynomials \citep{Johnson2002-nq, Cvijovic2011-ml}, which group the terms satisfying $m_1 + m_2 + \dots + m_{y-1} = n$ together,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:fdbbell}
    \frac{d^{y-1} Q(s)}{ds^{y-1}} \Bigr|_{s=0} = \sum_{n=1}^{y-1}  f^{(n)}(g(s)) B_{y-1,n}(g'(s), g''(s), \dots, g^{(y-n)}(s))
\end{equation}
where $B_{y-1,n}(g', g'', \dots, g^{(y-n)})$ are Bell polynomials of the derivatives of the inner function. Numerous programs can compute the Bell polynomials of the derivatives, e.g., the BellB package in R \citep{Rajala2019-hs} and the BellY function in Mathematica, provided a formula for the inner function derivative is supplied. 

Finally, we note that by definition of the probability generating function for the $A_is$ we can write down the following in terms of probabilities,
\begin{align}\label{eqn:p0}
   G(0) =  P(A_i=0) &= p_0 \notag \\
    &=> f^{(n)}= \frac{y!}{(y-n)!} p_0^{y-n} 
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}\label{eqn:pn}
    P(A_i=n) &= \frac{1}{n!} G^{(n)}(s)\Bigr|_{s=0} \notag \\
    &=> n! p_n = G^{(n)}(s)\Bigr|_{s=0}.
\end{align}
Equations \eqref{eqn:g}, \eqref{eqn:f} and \eqref{eqn:fdbbell}, together with \eqref{eqn:p0} and \eqref{eqn:pn}, can be used to compute the chain size distribution numerically, which is particularly advantageous when an analytical formula for the chain size distribution cannot be readily obtained. The advantage of using the above equations is that it can used with any probability generating function $G(s)$, provided $G(s)$ is a composition of differentiable functions $f$ and $g$ with a sufficient number of derivatives. Further, it can compute the chain size distribution arising from an offspring distribution that is a weighted sum of probability generating functions such as equation \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpgf}. 

%now write in terms of probabilities and explain how the algorithm works, ie make a vector of g_s and combine with the fs according to the fdb formula
%disadvantage: brute force; cannot deal with large chains bigger than 30, but it can deal with any form of G, including when G is a mixture. 
\subsection{Chain size distribution for the finite negative binomial mixture}

To derive the chain size distribution for the finite negative binomial mixture model \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf}, we use the result from \citet{Blumberg2013-xv}, and therefore require the derivatives of powers of the generating function $G_N(s)$ (equation \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpgf}). Let $$T_y(s) =  (G_N(s))^y, \quad y = 1, 2, \dots $$ Then the probability of a chain having size $y$ \citep{Dwass1969-gs, Blumberg2013-xv} is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cluster}
    P(Y = y)  =\frac{1}{y}\left( \frac{1}{(y-1)!}T_y^{(y-1)}(s) \Bigr|_{s=0} \right ) =  \frac{1}{y!}T_y^{(y-1)}(s) \Bigr|_{s=0}.
\end{equation}
To evaluate the derivatives of 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Qy}
   T_y(s)=  \left (\frac{p}{(1 + \frac{R_0^S}{k}(1-s))^k} +   \frac{(1-p)}{(1 + \frac{R_0^R}{k}(1-s))^k} \right)^y,
\end{equation}
we need to apply the chain rule for derivatives $y-1$ times.
The $n^{th}$ derivative of the inner function $g^{(n)}$ of equation \eqref{eqn:Qy},  $n = 1, 2, \dots, y-1$, evaluated at $s=0$ is
\begin{equation*}
    g^{(n)}(0) =  p \frac{(R_0^S)^n}{k^{n-1}} \displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^{n-1} (k+i) \left(1+\frac{R_0^S}{k}\right)^{-k-n}+ (1-p)\frac{(R_0^R)^n}{k^{n-1}} \displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^{n-1} (k+i)\left (1+\frac{R_0^R}{k}\right)^{-k-n}.
\end{equation*}
The $n^{th}$ derivative of the outer function $f^{(n)}$ of equation \eqref{eqn:Qy} evaluated at $s=0$ is
\begin{equation*}
    f^{(n)}(0) =  \frac{y!}{(y-n)! }\left (\frac{p}{(1 + \frac{R_0^S}{k})^k} +   \frac{(1-p)}{(1 + \frac{R_0^R}{k})^k} \right )^{y-n}, \quad n = 1, 2, \dots, y-1.
\end{equation*}
We substitute these formulas into the Faa di Bruno formula \eqref{eqn:fdbbell}, and compute the chain size distribution \eqref{eqn:cluster} arising from the finite negative binomial mixture offspring distribution \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf} numerically using the BellB  package in R \citep{Rajala2019-hs}.

%note what is not plotted here: major outbreaks.

%To examine the influence of having two contact processes with different intensities in the mixture model compared with having just one on the probability distribution, we compare the probability mass functions of the the mixture model \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf} with the standard model with same $R_0$ and dispersion parameter $k$ in Figure \ref{fig:pmf}. The probability of an infectious individual producing no secondary infections ($P(N=0)$) is higher in the mixture models than the base model for all values of $k$. As $k$ increases, the level of heterogeneity declines in that $P(N=0)$ declines in both models, but the standard model has a greater central tendency than the mixture model. In sum, there are visible differences in the probability mass functions of both models, and we conclude that having a mixture of two contact processes substantially affects the probability mass function. 


%In Figure \ref{fig:chains} we compare the chain size distributions of the mixture model ($R_0^R=1.1$, $p=0.1$, additional contacts $\delta =9$) with the standard model for $R_0>1$ and various values of $k$. The mean number of secondary infections for both models is $R_0 =2$. The mixture model chain size distribution is characterized by greater probabilities of observing small chains that go extinct (i.e., transmission chains consisting of less than 10 secondary infections) than the standard model. Assuming there is population structure in a dataset and $R_0>1$, we would expect to see more small chains compared to a dataset where there is no structuring in contact. For example, if $R_0=2$ and $k=2$, the mixture model predicts 64\% of transmission chains will be small. On the other hand, the standard model predicts just 38\% of infection clusters will be small, and the remainder will be major outbreaks (e.g., Figure \ref{fig:compcdf}). Figure \ref{fig:compcdf} shows there is a steep decline in the proportion of chains greater than a specified outbreak size between outbreak sizes of 1 and 20, and the drop-off is more pronounced for the mixture models than the standard models. This is because the probability of no secondary infections is larger for the the mixture model than the standard model \citep{Garske}. In sum, the chain size distribution, given a dataset consisting of small and major infection clusters, would look substantially different if there is underlying population structure in contact rates compared to one without. %something of interest - this isnt observed when R0<1...the base model has higher probs of small chains than the mixture model.

%also the R0<1 case has relevance for control. 

%should i show the converging to the major outbreak for each value of k? and how it is substantially different for each value of k

\subsection{Chain size distribution statistics}

To study the characteristics of the chain size distribution for $R_0>1$, using equation \eqref{eqn:R0star}, we numerically calculate the mean chain size conditioned on extinction \citep{Yan2008-jc}, 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:meanchain}
   E(Y|\text{minor outbreak}) = m_c= \frac{1}{1-R_0^*},
\end{equation}
and the variance of chain sizes conditioned on extinction,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:varchain}
    V(Y|\text{minor outbreak}) =v_c = \frac{s^* G_N''(s^*)+R_0^{*}(1-R_0^*)}{(1-R_0^*)^3}
\end{equation}
Using equation \eqref{eqn:cluster}, we also compute the proportion of chains greater than size $y$ (i.e., the area under the tail of the chain size distribution) by numerically calculating the complementary cumulative distribution function for $y = 1, 2,\dots,$
\begin{equation}
    P(Y>y) = 1-P(Y\leq y). 
\end{equation}

% As $R_0$ increases, the probability of a minor outbreak $z_\infty$ declines. Therefore $R_0^*$ declines with $R_0$, and so the mean chain size will also decline (Figure \ref{fig:meanchain}). For example, for the baseline Poisson model, $R_0^*= G'(z_\infty) = R_0 e^{(R_0(z_\infty -1 ))}$, which decreases as $z_\infty$ decreases.

\subsection{Numerical study of summary statistics}

Distinctive features of superspreading include  high probability of observing no secondary infections per infected individual, high variability in the number of secondary infections per infected individual, small probability of major epidemics, high variability in transmission chain sizes, and high probability of observing small transmission chains \citep{Althouse2020-dn}. Unlike the standard negative binomial model, the finite negative binomial mixture model \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf} represents superspreading in structured populations. We would like to understand how the population structure affects the stochastic characteristics of transmission chains. To compare the characteristics of the standard negative binomial model and finite mixture negative binomial model, we calculated four summary statistics. To assess differences in variability in cases in both models, we used the coefficient of variation of the number of secondary infections. To compare the chain size distributions arising from both models, we numerically calculated the the probability of a singular chain, the probability of a major outbreak, and the mean and coefficient of variation of minor outbreaks. 


To calculate the summary statistics, we ensured that the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the dispersion parameter $k$ were the same for each comparison of the standard and mixture models.  We assumed that 10\% of the population were superspreaders, with an $R_0^S$ of 10.1. Therefore, we set $R_0=2$, $p=0.1$, $R_0^R =1.1$ and $\delta = 9$ for all models studied. To explore the impact of variability in infectious period distributions in output from the standard and mixture models, we varied the dispersion parameter $k$ between $1/2$ and $4$.\comment{To study the effect of the proportion of superspreaders in the population on outbreaks,  we varied $p$ and $\delta$ in the mixture model while keeping the basic reproduction number fixed at $R_0 = R_0^R + p \delta = 2$. As $p$ is increased, the number of additional contacts $\delta$ must be reduced to keep $R_0$ fixed at 2, i.e., a superspreading group that forms a low proportion of the overall population must have a high additional contact rate over the average infectious period. We varied the superspreading proportion $p$ between $0.01$ and $1$ while simultaneously adjusting the number of additional contacts $\delta = (R_0 -R_0^R)/p$ with regular basic reproduction number $R_0^R$ fixed at 1.1 to retain $R_0$ at 2.}  All statistics were calculated using R 4.1.1 and code is supplied in XX.

\section{Comparison of mixture model with standard model}

%How does the addition of population structure affect stochastic characteristics at the beginning of an outbreak? Do they differ those arising from the standard model?

\subsection{Comparison of probability mass functions}

%%Parameter tables here

To examine the influence of subpopulations having different average contact rates, we compare the probability mass functions of the finite negative binomial mixture model \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf}, with the standard model, having identical $R_0$ and various values of dispersion parameter $k$ in Figure \ref{fig:pmf}. Under the standard model, the distribution of secondary infections as $k$ increases will become less skewed because the variance $R_0 + R_0^2/k$ declines in magnitude. In contrast, under the mixture model, as $k$ increases, the distribution of secondary infections retains long-tailed behavior due to the influence of the variability induced by population structure (\eqref{eqn:variance}). 
Further, the probability that an infectious individual produces no secondary infections ($P(N=0)$) is higher in the mixture models than the standard model for all values of $k$.  \footnote{what do you mean by ``greater central tendency''?: SO: Here, less skewed. } than the mixture model. In sum, there are visible differences in the probability mass functions of both models  because the variance in the number of secondary infections is greater under the mixture model than the standard model,  and the influence of risk subpopulations will dominate the variability in the number of secondary infections as $k \rightarrow \infty$. 

\begin{figure}%[!t] %F1
\centering\includegraphics {Figure1.pdf}
\caption{Probability mass functions of the mixture model ($R_0^R=1.1$, $p=0.1$, additional contacts $\delta =9$) compared with those of standard model with the same $R_0$ and dispersion parameter $k$. The mean number of secondary infections for both models is $R_0 =2$. For the mixture models, the probability of no secondary infections is always greater than the negative binomial model with the same $R_0$ and $k$. As $k$ increases, the number of secondary infections generated by the standard model becomes less skewed, whereas the finite mixture model retains long-tailed behavior. }

\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison of chain size distributions}



In Figure \ref{fig:chains}, we compare the chain size distributions of the mixture model with the standard model for various values of $k$. These chain size distributions result from the offspring distributions shown in Figure \ref{fig:pmf}.  The larger probability of singular chains in the mixture models is balanced by higher frequencies of small outbreaks consisting of 2, 3, 4, $\dots$ cases, which is particularly pronounced for larger dispersion values $k$. The mixture model chain size distributions are characterized by greater probabilities of observing small outbreaks that go extinct (i.e., transmission chains consisting of less than 10 secondary infections) than the standard model. For example, if $R_0 > 1$, the probability of observing a chain size of two, $p_1 p_0$, is greater for the mixture model than the standard model. This result suggests that assuming there is population structure in a dataset and $R_0>1$, we would expect to see higher frequencies of small chains compared to a dataset where there is no structuring in contact. %we note this is not observed when R0 < 1

%explore this more closely in figure 3 - need to read Garske
%the difference is more clearly captured by studying the tails
%Next we show that the tail of the distribution has very different properties for the mixture vs the standard model
The difference between the chain size distributions generated by the standard and mixture models when $R_0>1$ is more clearly captured by studying the tails of the chain size distributions in  Figure \ref{fig:compcdf}. The proportion of outbreaks greater than size $y$  converge to the probability of a major outbreak $1-s^*$ for large chain sizes $y$ (horizontal lines in each figure). There is a substantial difference in the predicted frequency of large clusters for the standard and mixture models.
For example, if $R_0=2$ and $k=2$, the mixture model predicts 36\% of transmission chains will be large (red horizontal line in  Figure \ref{fig:compcdf}c). On the other hand, the standard model predicts 62\% of infection clusters will be large (blue horizontal line in  Figure \ref{fig:compcdf}c), and the remainder will be small outbreaks (e.g., Figure \ref{fig:chains}c). Figure \ref{fig:compcdf} also shows there is a steep decline in the proportion of chains greater than a specified outbreak size between 1 and 20, and the drop-off is more pronounced for the mixture models than the standard models. This is because the probability of no secondary infections is larger for the mixture model than the standard model \citep{Garske2008-ax}.  In sum, these results suggest that the chain size distribution, given a dataset consisting of small and major infection clusters, would look substantially different if there is underlying population structure in contact rates compared to one without. %something of interest - this isnt observed when R0<1...the base model has higher probs of small chains than the mixture model.

The mean number of secondary infections for both models is $R_0 =2$. For the mixture models, the probability of a chain size of one is always greater than the negative binomial model with the same $R_0$ and $k$.  The chain size distribution is longer tailed for the mixture models compared to the corresponding standard models. }

\subsection{Comparison of summary statistics}

Calculation of summary statistics shows that the dispersion parameter $k$ does not have to be less than one for heterogeneity in outbreak sizes to arise \footnote{how do you characterize ``extreme'' heterogeneity? SO: Removed} from the finite negative binomial mixture model. For example, Table \ref{tab:summary} shows that the coefficient of variation of secondary infections arising from a mixture model with 10\% of individuals belonging to the superspreader group and a dispersion parameter of 2 is 93\% higher than that arising from a standard model with  the same mean and dispersion parameter $k$. The higher variance in the number of secondary infections induces a higher probability that a chain contains a single case, and greater variability in minor outbreak sizes (the coefficient of variation of the chain sizes from the mixture model with $k=2$ is 46\% higher than those obtained from the standard model). Major outbreaks in the mixture model with $k=2$ are 42\% less likely, and the mean size of small outbreaks is 39\% greater than the standard model. Table 2 shows that finite mixture negative binomial models with the same $R_0$ and $k$ have greater variability in chain sizes than those obtained from the standard model, and the outbreak distributions are characterized by higher probabilities of observing minor outbreaks. %In the next section we explore summary statistics across a range of values for the fraction of superspreaders $p$ and dispersion parameter $k$.

\subsection{Summary statistics} %results of summary stats study

%Hallmarks of superspreading include  high probability of observing no secondary infections per infected individual, high variability in the number of secondary infections per infected individual, small probability of major epidemics, high variability in transmission chain sizes, and high probability of observing small transmission chains. Unlike the standard negative binomial model, the mixture model \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf} assumed the population can be grouped by contact rate. We would like to understand how this affects the stochastic characteristics of transmission chains. To compare stochastic characteristics of the standard negative binomial model and finite mixture negative binomial model, we calculated four summary statistics. To assess differences in variability in cases in both models, we used the coefficient of variation of the number of secondary infections. To compare the chain size distributions arising from both models, we numerically calculated the probability of a major outbreak, and the mean and coefficient of variation of minor outbreaks. 

%To calculate the summary statistics, we ensured that the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the dispersion parameter $k$ were the same for each comparison of the standard and mixture models. We set $R_0=2$ for all models studied. To explore the impact of variability in infectious period distributions in output from the standard and mixture models, we varied the dispersion parameter $k$ between $1/2$ and $4$. To study the effect of the proportion of superspreaders in the population on outbreaks,  we varied $p$ and $\delta$ in the mixture model while keeping the basic reproduction number fixed at $R_0 = R_0^R + p \delta = 2$. As $p$ is increased, the number of additional contacts must be reduced to keep $R_0$ fixed at 2, i.e., a superspreading group that is a low proportion of the overall population must have a high additional contact rate over the average infectious period. We varied the superspreading proportion $p$  between $0.01$ and $1$ while simultaneously adjusting the number of additional contacts $\delta = (R_0 -R_0^R)/p$ with regular basic reproduction number $R_0^R$ fixed at 1.1 to retain $R_0$ at 2.  All statistics were calculated using R 4.1.1 and code is supplied in XX. 



%move to discussion Statistics generated using the mixture model \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf} differ substantially from those generated using the standard model if the population consists of a low proportion of superspreaders (Figures 4-7). Taken together, these results suggest that comparing across different heterogeneous population combinations with the same $R_0$ and $k$ leads to very different outbreak dynamics than those obtained from the baseline model, and these outbreaks are characterized by higher probabilities of observing a chain that extinguishes quickly and greater variability in the sizes of minor outbreaks.

 A measure of variability of cases generated per individual is the coefficient of variation of secondary infections.  Figure \ref{fig:CVcases} shows the coefficient of variation for the mixture and standard models for $R_0=2$ and various values of dispersion parameter $k$ as the fraction of superspreaders $p$ is varied. High variability in the mixture offspring distribution is predicted for all values of $k$ provided the average number of additional contacts $\delta$ is large (i.e., fraction of superspreaders $p$ is small). The coefficient of variation generated from the mixture model decreases with $p$ and converges to the corresponding value of the standard model with $R_0=2$ as $p\rightarrow 1$ ($\delta\rightarrow R_0-R_0^R$) because $p R_0^S+(1-p)R_0^R$ approaches $R_0^S = R_0$. The greatest disparity between the mixture model and standard model is for mixtures with small dispersion parameter $k$, small proportion of superspreaders $p$ and large average number of additional contacts $\delta$. 
 
 \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{Figure4.pdf}
    \caption{Coefficient of variation of secondary infections in the mixture model is highest for small dispersion parameter $k$, small $p$ and large number of additional contacts $\delta$. The coefficient of variation of secondary infections in the mixture model decreases as $p$ increases and approaches the value of the standard model as $p$ approaches 1. There is greater variability in the number of secondary infections in the mixture model compared to the standard model, even if $k>1$, with the highest variability for small dispersion parameter $k$, small $p$ and large number of additional contacts.  }
    \label{fig:CVcases}
\end{figure}

 
 The pattern in variability of secondary infections drives the behavior of the coefficient of variation in chain sizes (Figure \ref{fig:CVchain}), with chain size distributions generated by mixtures exhibiting high variability for large $\delta$,  small $p$ and small $k$. However, Figure \ref{fig:meanchain} shows that the mean of chain sizes conditioned on extinction increases with dispersion parameter $k$, with the largest means for small $p$, large $\delta$ and large $k$, suggesting that infectious periods with a central tendency combined with heterogeneous contact patterns could generate sizeable transmission chains.

There is greater variability in chain sizes in the mixture model compared to the standard model, even if $k>1$, with the highest coefficients of variation observed for small dispersion parameter $k$, small $p$ and large number of additional contacts. }

    \label{fig:meanchain}
\end{figure}

 
  In Figure \ref{fig:outbreak}, the probability of a major epidemic increases with $p$ and $k$, converging to the value predicted by the standard model as $p$ approaches 1, with the lowest values occurring for small $k$ and small $p$ (large $R_0^S$). The biggest disparity in predictions for frequency of large clusters between the mixture and standard model occurs for $k=4$. The mixture model with small $p$ and large $\delta$ retains low probability of large clusters, a hallmark of superspreading,  unlike  the corresponding standard model.

\section{Control activities}

 %What features should be targeted that would control an epidemic? Which strategy would lead to the greatest reduction in the probability of a major epidemic? How do control strategies affect case variability? %reduction in cases?
%\subsection{Numerical analysis} %studies (assuming $R_0$ > 1)
%How statistics vary with $p$, $\delta$ and $k$, keeping $R_0$ fixed, for the baseline and mixture models (compare the degree of heterogeneity in outbreak patterns)
%Effect of control activities on outbreak patterns: decrease $R_0^R$, $p$ and $\delta$ by factor $1-c$ and study their effect on variance to mean ratio and probability of extinction (which control activity induces greatest probability of extinction for a given level of control effort below the threshold (assuming the threshold for all activities is the same) and do patterns become more heterogeneous as epidemic control is applied?)

How do we control superspreading in a heterogeneous population? Control efforts can either target superspreaders alone, or they can be focused towards both superspreading and regular groups. Here we will study the effect of three ways of reducing the basic reproduction number $R_0$:
\begin{itemize}
\item[Strategy (a)] decreasing the proportion $p$ of individuals in the population with high contact rate, which may
be considered to be the same as increasing the proportion of the population that become vaccinated or increasing the proportion of the population who respond to information about disease risk through education; %self-isolate when sick or comply with
%stay-at-home orders/physical distancing, comply with face covering mandates or other measures that reduce the chance of transmission;
\item [Strategy (b)] decreasing the number of additional contacts per individual $\tilde{\delta}$ in the superspreading group, e.g., this group practises self-isolation when symptomatic;
\item [Strategy (c)] decreasing baseline transmission rate in both groups by reducing $R_0^R$, e.g., both groups wear face coverings, practise social distancing or mix in a well-ventilated environment. 
\end{itemize}
Strategies (a) and (b) are aimed towards reducing the degree of superspreading, and are similar to the targeted individual control policies suggested in \citet{Lloyd-Smith2005-ma}. Strategy (c) focuses decreasing transmission in both groups and is therefore a population-wide control policy \citep{Lloyd-Smith2005-ma}, called \textit{generalized interventions} by \citet{Drake2021-vi}. For each strategy, we calculate the critical control effort threshold for elimination, i.e., the level of effort required for the probability of a major epidemic to be zero. We ask which of these strategies leads to the fastest reduction in the probability of a major epidemic for the least level of effort, assuming that the critical threshold for elimination is the same for all activities. 

\subsection{Critical thresholds for elimination}

We first study the effect of targeted control activities on the superspreading group (Strategy a) by denting control effort by $c$, $0\leq c\leq 1$, where $c=0$ implies the application of no control effort and $c=1$ indicates full control of  transmission. We then alter population structure by reducing $p$ (thereby increasing $1-p$) by a factor $1-c$ while keeping all other parameters fixed. For comparison, we next reduce the individual reproduction number by decreasing the number of additional contacts over the course of an average infectious period $\delta$ by a factor $1-c$ while keeping all other parameters fixed (Strategy b).  Strategies (a) and (b) have the same effective $R_0$,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:effectiveR0S}
R_{0e}^{S} = R_0^R + (1-c) p \delta.
\end{equation}
When $c=1$, effective $R_0$ is the same as $R_0^R$, the basic reproduction number of the pathogen in the regular transmission group. If $R_0 > 1$, the threshold control effort for elimination when control is limited to the superspreading group is 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:thresholdS}
c^{S} = 1 -\frac{ (1-R_0^R)}{p \delta}    = \frac{R_0-1}{p \delta} =\frac{R_0-1}{R_0-R_0^R}, \quad 0< c^{S} \leq 1.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the pathogen can only be eliminated in the entire population if $R_0^R < 1$, i.e., the regular group cannot sustain the infection alone. 


We also study the effect of mitigation measures on both groups (strategy (c)), by reducing $R_0^R$ by a factor $1-c$. Strategy (c) has a different expression to strategies (a) and (b) for effective $R_0$,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:effectiveR0SR}
R_{0e}^{SR} = (1-c) R_0^R + p \delta, 
\end{equation}
and consequently, yields a different expression for threshold control effort,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:thresholdSR}
c^{SR} = 1 -\frac{ (1-p \delta)}{R_0^R} = \frac{R_0-1}{R_0^R}, \quad 0 < c^{SR} \leq 1.
\end{equation}
In this case, if $c=1$, then $R_{0e}^{SR} = p \delta$, and elimination of the disease in the entire population can only be achieved provided $p \delta = R_0 - R_0^R < 1$, i.e., the superspreading group cannot have too many additional contacts, or the proportion of superspreaders in the population cannot be too large. 

The critical control thresholds  \eqref{eqn:thresholdS} and \eqref{eqn:thresholdSR} are equal if and only if $R_0 = 2 R_0^R$, or equivalently $R_0^R = p \delta$. If $R_0< 2 R_0^R$ (i.e., $p\delta <R_0^R$) then $c^{SR}<c^{S}$ and targeting control activities towards both groups leads to a lower threshold for elimination. On the other hand, if $R_0>2R_0^R$ (i.e., $p \delta > R_0^R$) then $c^{S}< c^{SR}$ and targeting control activities towards the superspreading group  alone induces more efficient elimination. %is a more efficient strategy

Comparing the effective reproduction numbers \eqref{eqn:effectiveR0S} and \eqref{eqn:effectiveR0SR}, if $p \delta < R_0^R$ (i.e., superspreaders contribute little to $R_0$), use of control activities that target both groups is a more effective strategy than targeting superspreaders alone since $R_{0e}^{SC} < R_{0e}^{S}$.   On the other hand, if $p\delta > R_0^R$, $R_{0e}^{S} < R_{0e}^{SC}$ and so targeting superspreading leads to a greater reduction in $R_0$ than targeting both groups with control. 

%context dependent
\subsection{Variance-to-mean ratio}

To study how control activities impact heterogeneity in outbreak patterns, we examine the variance-to-mean ratio of the number of secondary infections. We expect that if control efforts focus on actions that reduce $p$ or $\delta$, heterogeneity in outbreaks should decline with the level of control effort because the superspreading risk group is being directly targeted. On the other hand, if both groups are subject to control activity with regular transmission $R_0^R$ being targeted (and therefore $R_0^A=R_0^R + \delta$ also being targeted), the influence of the superspreading group may dominate outbreak patterns. For example, at $c=1$, if only the superspreading group is targeted, the variance-to-mean ratio is $1+R_0^R/k$, whereas if both groups are simultaneously targeted, it is $1+\delta/k + \delta(1-p)$. In the full control scenario, if $\delta > R_0^R$, then the variance-to-mean ratio for control applied to both groups is larger than that for control applied to only the superspreading subpopulation, whereas if $\delta$ is very small, the variance-to-mean ratio for both group control is close to unity. 

%note this is not the only way...this is just a numerical example. Will get difference answers depending on the critical threshold for each strategy..
%To answer the question of how the three control activities of interest affect outbreak patterns as epidemic control $c$ is applied, we would like the threshold for extinction to be the same for all activities, and therefore effective $R_0$ declines at the same rate.
\subsection{Numerical case study}

These analytical results show that disease elimination under each control activity is only possible in certain circumstances.  To assess how case variability and the probability of a major outbreak change with each control strategy, we choose parameters such that the threshold for elimination is the same value for all activities, and consequently, effective $R_0$ declines at the same rate. We start with $R_0^R = 0.9 <1$, which guarantees extinction for targeted control because the threshold will be less than one. We choose $R_0 = 2 R_0^R = 1.8$, which means that $p \delta = 0.9 <1$, so extinction will be guaranteed if control to both groups is applied. We choose $p = 0.1$, $\delta = 9$ and $k=1/2$. In this scenario, effective $R_0$ (equations \eqref{eqn:effectiveR0S} and \eqref{eqn:effectiveR0SR}) is the same for all three strategies. Then we decrease each of $R_0^R$, $p$ and $\delta$ by a factor $1-c$ in increments of 0.01 and examine their effect on the variance-to-mean ratio of secondary infections, the probability of extinction, and the percentage reduction in the probability of a major outbreak from the baseline at $c=0$.


Figures \ref{fig:varmeanratio}-\ref{fig:extprob} show that control strategies have different impacts on probability of extinction and  variance-to-mean ratio as a function of control effort even when the threshold for extinction is the same for all three strategies ($c^S = c^{SR} = 8/9$). Control actions that act on both groups lead to greater heterogeneity in outbreaks (i.e., higher variance-to-mean ratio in secondary infections) than control measures that act on superspreaders only (e.g., reducing the number of additional contacts $\delta$ and reducing the proportion of superspreaders $p$). This is because when both groups are controlled, the risk group component of the variance in equation \eqref{eqn:variance} remains unchanged as $R_0^R$ declines, and therefore, its relative contribution to the variance increases as the relative contributions of the other components decline. In contrast, when control actions act on superspreaders alone, the variance is dominated by the influence of decreasing $R_0$. 

%the following percentages need to be checked
For low levels of control effort, Figure \ref{fig:percentchange} shows that targeting both groups reduces the probability of a major epidemic more efficiently than targeting superspreaders. For example, the chance of a major outbreak is reduced by 25\% if control aimed at both groups at 12.5\% effort is applied. The superspreading proportion would have to reduced by ~37.5\%, or the number of additional contacts made by superspreaders would have to be decreased by ~50\% to reduce the chance of a major outbreak by 25\%.  However, targeting both groups comes at a cost that the other control activities do not have: increased variability in the number of cases generated per person (Figure \ref{fig:varmeanratio}). On the other hand, we note that while reduction of contacts is the control activity that reduces heterogeneity in outbreaks the most, it is also the least effective in terms of reducing the chances of a major outbreak. Targeting the proportion of superspreaders offers the middle ground of together reducing the variance-to-mean ratio and the probability of a major outbreak with increasing control effort. %We note that these results depend on the scenario

%In conclusion, for high levels of control effort better to focus on targeting the superspreading group because it will also reduce heterogeneity in cases

\section{Discussion}

Theory developed here shows that contact structure coupled with infectious period heterogeneity leads to an overdispersed mixture offspring distribution. We show that the variance of the mixture model can be decomposed into variation driven by the different contact rates per group, and overdispersion driven by the infectious period. Our mechanistic model can retain the features of superspreading even with less skewed infectious period distributions, provided the influence of superspreaders in the overall population is strong, i.e., there is a large average number of additional contacts made per superspreader. We describe a flexible method for calculating the chain size distribution, which could be applied to other branching process models of infectious disease transmission. Our findings also show how individual-level behavior modifications and population-level control measures differently affect critical thresholds for control.

Statistics generated using our mixture model \eqref{eqn:nbinommixpmf} differ substantially from those generated using the standard model if the population consists of a low proportion of superspreaders (e.g., Table \ref{tab:summary}).  If the superspreading group has a large average number of contacts relative to the regular group, the variance of the offspring mixture distribution and the probability of observing a singular chain together drive the difference between the finite negative binomial mixture and the standard negative binomial offspring distributions. Different offspring distributions induce different predictions for the frequency of large infection clusters when $R_0>1$. In their study of Poisson mixtures, \citet{Kremer2021-bi} similarly found that offspring distribution tail behavior depended on the model studied. We agree with their recommendation to compare different offspring distributions when fitting these models to data. 



Assuming that the underlying outbreak dynamics can be described by a finite mixture negative binomial model, the critical threshold for disease elimination depends on control strategy. The control strategies we explore target superspreaders by reducing the proportion of superspreaders (strategy (a)) or the number of additional contacts made per superspreader (strategy (b)), whereas strategy (c) is applied to the entire population. Our work suggests that directing control actions on all groups, e.g., via lockdowns, may be more suitable if the population is more homogeneous. We also show that elimination is only possible under strategies (a) and (b) provided $R_0$ of the pathogen in the regular group drops below one. This finding suggests that additional targeting of the group via population-wide measures such as stay-at-home orders may also be needed for elimination to be achieved. 


Our modeling approach has some limitations. We assume the same dispersion parameter $k$ for both groups in the population. For example, the superspreading group may have greater variability in the duration of their infections than the regular group. To allow for this, the model could be adapted so that the distribution of infectious periods in the superspreading group would be described by a lower dispersion parameter than that of the regular group. Our approach also assumes that the proportion of individuals that belong to each risk group can be identified \textit{a priori}. We expect that this would be achievable in closed settings such as care homes or in professional sports teams. Our approach yields a method for calculating the chain size distribution that may yield an analytical formula for some mixtures but for more complicated models such as the mixture model in this paper, it does not yield an analytical expression, which makes the approach less useful for model fitting to data.  %%SO: I am not sure if this is true. 


In conclusion, our model suggests that the addition of risk structure, together with infectious period heterogeneity, leads to variable outbreak dynamics, even if the infectious period distribution is symmetric about its mean. We recommend researchers examine mechanistic alternatives to the standard negative binomial model when studying outbreak distributions.
