              occur during pre-symptomatic infection. Unlike influenza, most
              SARS-CoV-2-infected people do not transmit while a small
              percentage infect large numbers of people. We designed
              mathematical models which link observed viral loads with
              epidemiologic features of each virus, including distribution of
              transmissions attributed to each infected person and duration
              between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected
              person. We identify that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or
              influenza can be highly contagious for less than 1 day, congruent
              with peak viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events occur when
              an infected person is shedding at a very high viral load and has
              a high number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition of
              SARS-CoV-2 toward super-spreading events cannot be attributed to
              additional weeks of shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a
              person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people within
              equivalent physical contact networks, likely due to

              the transmission dynamics of the virus and to analyze the
              performance of possible containment strategies. Models have
              focused primarily on the reproductive numbers of the disease that
              represent the average number of secondary infections produced by
              a random infectious individual. However, these population-level
              estimates may conflate important systematic variation in the
              number of cases generated by infected individuals, particularly
              found in spatially localized transmission and superspreading
              events. Although superspreading features prominently in
              first-hand narratives of Ebola transmission, its dynamics have
              not been systematically characterized, hindering refinements of
              future epidemic predictions and explorations of targeted
              interventions. We used Bayesian model inference to integrate
              individual-level spatial information with other epidemiological
              data of community-based (undetected within clinical-care systems)
              cases and to explicitly infer distribution of the cases generated

              ([Formula: see text]61\%) of the infections. Our results also
              suggest age as a key demographic predictor for superspreading. We
              also show that community-based cases may have progressed more
              rapidly than those notified within clinical-care systems, and
              most transmission events occurred in a relatively short distance
              (with median value of 2.51 km). Our results stress the importance
              of characterizing superspreading of Ebola, enhance our current

              of secondary infections produced by an infected individual is a
              function of three components: an individual's infectiousness, the
              rate at which it contacts susceptible indi- viduals and the
              duration of infection. Individual-level variation can emerge in
              each of these components through a combination of behavioural and
              physiological mechanisms. 3. In this review, we describe
              mechanisms that promote variation in the number of individuals to
              which an individual transmits a pathogen, emphasizing insights
              that can be gained by understanding which components of

              heterogeneity among species. 4. Strategies for quantifying each

              focusing on only one component of the infection process may be
              misleading. 5. To conclude, we describe how future research
              focusing on variation in transmission across all three components

              is a rare disease with only one documented major epidemic in a

              negative-binomial offspring distribution is known, and examine
              the sensitivity of the reproduction number to variation in
              dispersion. Assuming a geometric offspring distribution with k=1,
              the reproduction number was estimated at 1.16 (95\% confidence

              stuttering chain data have important applications in disease
              surveillance and management. Previous researchers have used chain
              size distributions to infer [Formula: see text], but estimation
              of the degree of individual-level variation in infectiousness (as
              quantified by the dispersion parameter, [Formula: see text]) has
              typically required contact tracing data. Utilizing branching
              process theory along with a negative binomial offspring
              distribution, we demonstrate how maximum likelihood estimation
              can be applied to chain size data to infer both [Formula: see
              text] and the dispersion parameter that characterizes
              heterogeneity. While the maximum likelihood value for [Formula:
              see text] is a simple function of the average chain size, the
              associated confidence intervals are dependent on the inferred
              degree of transmission heterogeneity. As demonstrated for
              monkeypox data from the Democratic Republic of Congo, this
              impacts when a statistically significant change in [Formula: see
              text] is detectable. In addition, by allowing for superspreading
              events, inference of [Formula: see text] shifts the threshold
              above which a transmission chain should be considered anomalously
              large for a given value of [Formula: see text] (thus reducing the
              probability of false alarms about pathogen adaptation). Our
              analysis of monkeypox also clarifies the various ways that
              imperfect observation can impact inference of transmission
              parameters, and highlights the need to quantitatively evaluate
              whether observation is likely to significantly bias results.",

              Less dispersed distributions are seen to have two important

              describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does
              not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central
              to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic
              reproductive number, R0, which is defined as the mean number of
              infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible
              population. Population estimates of R0 can obscure considerable
              individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the
              global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by
              numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals
              infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases
              transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or
              smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure
              empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has
              been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and
              statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in
              infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data
              from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the
              distribution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often
              highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation
              differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease
              extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive.
              Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control,
              showing that individual-specific control measures outperform
              population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements
              achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to
              identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our
              findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of
              disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a

              large and well-mixed host populations. Many human and wildlife
              systems, however, have small groups with limited movement among
              groups. In these situations, the basic reproductive number, R0,
              is likely to be a poor predictor of a disease pandemic because it
              typically does not account for group structure and movement of
              individuals among groups. We extend recent work by combining the
              movement of hosts, transmission within groups, recovery from
              infection and the recruitment of new susceptibles into a
              stochastic model of disease in a host metapopulation. We focus on
              how recruitment of susceptibles affects disease invasion and how
              population structure can affect the frequency of superspreading
              events (SSEs). We show that the frequency of SSEs may decrease
              with the reduced movement and the group sizes due to the limited
              number of susceptible individuals available. Classification tree
              analysis of the model results illustrates the hierarchical nature
              of disease invasion in host metapopulations. First, the pathogen
              must effectively transmit within a group (R0>1), and then the
              pathogen must persist within a group long enough to allow for
              movement among the groups. Therefore, the factors affecting
              disease persistence--such as infectious period, group size and
              recruitment of new susceptibles--are as important as the local

              misinformation on this critical topic. This article presents a
              comprehensive review of the evidence on transmission of this
              virus. Although several experimental studies have cultured live

              real-world studies that detect viral RNA in the environment
              report very low levels, and few have isolated viable virus.
              Strong evidence from case and cluster reports indicates that
              respiratory transmission is dominant, with proximity and
              ventilation being key determinants of transmission risk. In the
              few cases where direct contact or fomite transmission is

              rural) counties in the state of Georgia. First, our results show
              that the reproductive number reduced to below one in about 2 wk

              widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly

              cases of COVID-19 are compressed into a short period of time
              (peakedness of the epidemic) is strongly shaped by population
              aggregation and heterogeneity, such that epidemics in crowded
              cities are more spread over time, and crowded cities have larger
              total attack rates than less populated cities. Observed
              differences in the peakedness of epidemics are consistent with a
              meta-population model of COVID-19 that explicitly accounts for
              spatial hierarchies. We paired our estimates with globally
              comprehensive data on human mobility and predict that crowded

              central role in this dilemma because the movement of people
              enables both economic activity and virus spread. We use mobility
              data in the form of counts of travellers between regions, to
              extend the often-used SEIR models to include mobility between

              the restrictions are minimal while the infection spread is
              effectively limited. We consider restrictions where the country
              is divided into regions, and study scenarios where mobility is
              allowed within these regions, and disallowed between them. We

  abstract = "The spatial dynamics of epidemics are fundamentally affected by
              patterns of human mobility. Mobile phone call detail records
              (CDRs) are a rich source of mobility data, and allow
              semi-mechanistic models of movement to be parameterised even for
              resource-poor settings. While the gravity model typically
              reproduces human movement reasonably well at the administrative
              level spatial scale, past studies suggest that parameter
              estimates vary with the level of spatial discretisation at which
              models are fitted. Given that privacy concerns usually preclude
              public release of very fine-scale movement data, such variation
              would be problematic for individual-based simulations of epidemic
              spread parametrised at a fine spatial scale. We therefore present
              new methods to fit fine-scale mathematical mobility models (here
              we implement variants of the gravity and radiation models) to
              spatially aggregated movement data and investigate how model
              parameter estimates vary with spatial resolution. We use gridded
              population data at 1km resolution to derive population counts at
              different spatial scales (down to ∼ 5km grids) and implement
              mobility models at each scale. Parameters are estimated from
              administrative-level flow data between overnight locations in
              Kenya and Namibia derived from CDRs: where the model spatial
              resolution exceeds that of the mobility data, we compare the flow
              data between a particular origin and destination with the sum of
              all model flows between cells that lie within those particular
              origin and destination administrative units. Clear evidence of
              over-dispersion supports the use of negative binomial instead of
              Poisson likelihood for count data with high values. Radiation
              models use fewer parameters than the gravity model and better
              predict trips between overnight locations for both considered
              countries. Results show that estimates for some parameters change
              between countries and with spatial resolution and highlight how

              is no exception. A skewed distribution where few individuals or
              events are responsible for the majority of transmission can
              result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid
              and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in
              epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can
              produce large reductions in overall transmission rates. Here, we
              present a compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework
              for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly
              observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and
              mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level
              heterogeneity in transmission using previous estimates for
              SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for COVID-19
              epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate
              that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention
              strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically
              distinct settings---Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties,
              California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta (Dekalb
              and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County),
              Florida. We find the effective reproduction number R E dropped
              below 1 rapidly following social distancing orders in mid-March,
              2020 and remained there into June in Santa Clara County and
              Seattle, but climbed above 1 in late May in Los Angeles, Miami,
              and Atlanta, and has trended upward in all locations since April.
              With the fitted model, we ask: how does truncating the tail of
              the individual-level transmission rate distribution affect
              epidemic dynamics and control? We find interventions that
              truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially
              relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on
              epidemic growth on par with the strongest population-wide social
              distancing observed in April, 2020. Given that social distancing
              interventions will be needed to maintain epidemic control until a
              vaccine becomes widely available, ``chopping off the tail'' to
              reduce the probability of superspreading events presents a

              through contact in three sectors: ``close'' (a small, unchanging

              the transmissibility of emerging viruses remains a longstanding
              question in infectious disease epidemiology. Methods: Here, we
              use systematic review to develop a comprehensive dataset of
              respiratory viral loads (rVLs) of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and
              influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. We then comparatively meta-analyze the
              data and model individual infectiousness by shedding viable virus
              via respiratory droplets and aerosols. Results: The analyses
              indicate heterogeneity in rVL as an intrinsic virological factor
              facilitating greater overdispersion for SARS-CoV-2 in the
              COVID-19 pandemic than A(H1N1)pdm09 in the 2009 influenza
              pandemic. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity remains broad
              throughout the infectious period, including for pediatric and
              asymptomatic infections. Hence, many COVID-19 cases inherently
              present minimal transmission risk, whereas highly infectious
              individuals shed tens to thousands of SARS-CoV-2 virions/min via
              droplets and aerosols while breathing, talking and singing.
              Coughing increases the contagiousness, especially in close
              contact, of symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones.
              Infectiousness tends to be elevated between 1-5 days post-symptom
              onset. Conclusions: Intrinsic case variation in rVL facilitates
              overdispersion in the transmissibility of emerging respiratory
              viruses. Our findings present considerations for disease control

               interactions between individual variation in behavior and
               physiology scale-up to affect pathogen transmission at a

               covariation between the behavioral and physiological components
               of transmission might affect epidemic outcomes in host
               populations. We tested the consequences of contact rate
               covarying with susceptibility, infectiousness, and infection
               status using an individual-based, dynamic network model where
               individuals initiate and terminate contacts with conspecifics
               based on their behavioral predispositions and their infection
               status. Our results suggest that both heterogeneity in
               physiology and subsequent covariation of physiology with contact
               rate could powerfully influence epidemic dynamics. Overall, we
               found that 1) individual variability in susceptibility and
               infectiousness can reduce the expected maximum prevalence and
               increase epidemic variability; 2) when contact rate and
               susceptibility or infectiousness negatively covary, it takes
               substantially longer for epidemics to spread throughout the
               population, and rates of epidemic spread remained suppressed
               even for highly transmissible pathogens; and 3) reductions in
               contact rate resulting from infection-induced behavioral changes
               can prevent the pathogen from reaching most of the population.
               These effects were strongest for theoretical pathogens with
               lower transmissibility and for populations where the observed
               variation in contact rate was higher, suggesting that such
               heterogeneity may be most important for less infectious, more
               chronic diseases in wildlife. Understanding when and how

              to muddled public health policies, and impeded clear messaging on
              how best to slow transmission of COVID-19. In particular, current
              recommendations have been based on four tenets: 1) respiratory

              manner of ``droplets'' versus ``aerosols''; 2) this dichotomy

              Because closures are costly and damaging, many jurisdictions have
              since reopened schools with control measures in place. Early
              evidence indicated that schools were low risk and children were
              unlikely to be very infectious, but it is becoming clear that
              children and youth can acquire and transmit COVID-19 in school
              settings and that transmission clusters and outbreaks can be
              large. We describe the contrasting literature on school
              transmission, and argue that the apparent discrepancy can be
              reconciled by heterogeneity, or ``overdispersion'' in
              transmission, with many exposures yielding little to no risk of
              onward transmission, but some unfortunate exposures causing
              sizeable onward transmission. In addition, respiratory viral
              loads are as high in children and youth as in adults, pre- and
              asymptomatic transmission occur, and the possibility of aerosol
              transmission has been established. We use a stochastic
              individual-based model to find the implications of these combined
              observations for cluster sizes and control measures. We consider
              both individual and environment/activity contributions to the

              sizes in the classroom setting, with clusters ranging from 1 to
              20 individuals in a class of 25. None of the mitigation protocols

              rapid universal monitoring (for example by regular, onsite,

              transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high

              superspreading events) may be large as some countries have
              observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We
              quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by
              applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in
              affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local
              cases in the affected countries from the World Health
              Organization situation report and applied a branching process
              model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to
              follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model
              suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the
              transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R
              0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial
              distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1;
              95\% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80\% of
              secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction
              of infectious individuals (~10\%). A joint estimation yielded
              likely ranges for R 0 and k (95\% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2);
              however, the upper bound of R 0 was not well informed by the
              model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the
              prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a
              highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a
              potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on
              superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to

              generalizability of modelling frameworks in a policy context, new
              sources of data on relevant aspects of human behaviour are
              increasingly available. Researchers have begun to embrace data
              from mobile devices and other technologies as useful proxies for
              behavioural drivers of disease transmission, but there is much
              work to be done to measure and validate these approaches,
              particularly for policy-making. Here we discuss how integrating
              local knowledge in the design of model frameworks and the
              interpretation of new data streams offers the possibility of
              policy-relevant models for public health decision-making as well

              behaviour in relation to infectious diseases.",

              SARS-COV-2 infections is critical to assess the effectiveness of
              public health measures such as contact tracing. Methods: Here, we
              develop a novel mechanistic approach to infer the infectiousness
              profile of SARS-COV-2-infected individuals using data from known
              infector-infectee pairs. We compare estimates of key
              epidemiological quantities generated using our mechanistic method
              with analogous estimates generated using previous approaches.
              Results: The mechanistic method provides an improved fit to data
              from SARS-CoV-2 infector-infectee pairs compared to commonly used
              approaches. Our best-fitting model indicates a high proportion of
              presymptomatic transmissions, with many transmissions occurring
              shortly before the infector develops symptoms. Conclusions: High
              infectiousness immediately prior to symptom onset highlights the

              using mathematics both for prediction and to gain a deeper
              understanding. However the study of infectious diseases is a
              highly interdisciplinary subject requiring insights from multiple

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In classical mathematical epidemiology, individuals
              do not adapt their contact behavior during epidemics. They do not
              endogenously engage, for example, in social distancing based on
              fear. Yet, adaptive behavior is well-documented in true
              epidemics. We explore the effect of including such behavior in
              models of epidemic dynamics. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              Using both nonlinear dynamical systems and agent-based
              computation, we model two interacting contagion processes: one of
              disease and one of fear of the disease. Individuals can
              ``contract'' fear through contact with individuals who are
              infected with the disease (the sick), infected with fear only
              (the scared), and infected with both fear and disease (the sick
              and scared). Scared individuals--whether sick or not--may remove
              themselves from circulation with some probability, which affects
              the contact dynamic, and thus the disease epidemic proper. If we
              allow individuals to recover from fear and return to circulation,
              the coupled dynamics become quite rich, and can include multiple
              waves of infection. We also study flight as a behavioral
              response. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In a spatially extended
              setting, even relatively small levels of fear-inspired flight can
              have a dramatic impact on spatio-temporal epidemic dynamics.
              Self-isolation and spatial flight are only two of many possible
              actions that fear-infected individuals may take. Our main point
              is that behavioral adaptation of some sort must be considered.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to
              control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for
              coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will
              achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen
              and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if
              isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards
              transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We
              developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the
              COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential
              effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at
              controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
              (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied
              in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number
              (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability
              that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that
              occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical
              infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further
              transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if
              transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total.
              We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation
              and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of
              cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.
              FINDINGS: Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases,
              an R0 of 1·5, and 0\% transmission before symptom onset could be
              controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however,
              the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the
              number of initial cases, when R0 was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more
              transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial
              numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1·5
              were controllable with less than 50\% of contacts successfully
              traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2·5 more
              than 70\% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3·5 more
              than 90\% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom
              onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether
              an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1·5. For R0 values of
              2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and
              isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1\% of
              transmission occurred before symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: In
              most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case
              isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within
              3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays
              from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by
              contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms.
              This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission
              characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control
              to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

              secondary cases which biases toward lower asymptomaticity. We

              Organization Global Research Database on COVID-19 between January
              1, 2020 and April 2, 2021 to identify studies that reported
              silent infections at the time of testing, whether presymptomatic
              or asymptomatic. Index cases were removed to minimize
              representational bias that would result in overestimation of
              symptomaticity. By analyzing over 350 studies, we estimate that
              the percentage of infections that never developed clinical
              symptoms, and thus were truly asymptomatic, was 35.1\% (95\% CI:
              30.7 to 39.9\%). At the time of testing, 42.8\% (95\% prediction
              interval: 5.2 to 91.1\%) of cases exhibited no symptoms, a group
              comprising both asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections.
              Asymptomaticity was significantly lower among the elderly, at

              cases with no underlying medical conditions. Without proactive
              policies to detect asymptomatic infections, such as rapid contact

              population but little broader spread, whereas other introductions
              into the facility had little effect. The second, at an
              international business conference, produced sustained community
              transmission and was exported, resulting in extensive regional,
              national, and international spread. The two events also differed
              substantially in the genetic variation they generated, suggesting
              varying transmission dynamics in superspreading events. Our
              results show how genomic epidemiology can help to understand the

                 diseases have caused large, deadly, and expensive
                 multi-national outbreaks. Often outbreak investigations aim to
                 identify who infected whom by reconstructing the outbreak
                 transmission tree, which visualizes transmission between
                 individuals as a network with nodes representing individuals
                 and branches representing transmission from person to person.
                 We compiled a database of 383 published, standardized
                 transmission trees consisting of 16 directly-transmitted
                 diseases ranging in size from 2 to 286 cases. For each tree
                 and disease we calculated several key statistics, such as
                 outbreak size, average number of secondary infections, the
                 dispersion parameter, and the number of superspreaders. We
                 demonstrated the potential utility of the database through
                 short analyses addressing questions about superspreader
                 epidemiology for a variety of diseases, including COVID-19.
                 First, we compared the frequency and contribution of
                 superspreaders to onward transmission across diseases.
                 COVID-19 outbreaks had significantly fewer superspreaders than
                 outbreaks of SARS and MERS and a dispersion parameter between
                 that of SARS and MERS. Across diseases the presence of more
                 superspreaders was associated with greater outbreak size.
                 Second, we further examined how early spread impacts tree
                 size. Generally, trees sparked by a superspreader had larger
                 outbreak sizes than those trees not sparked by a
                 superspreader, and this trend was significant for COVID-19
                 trees. Third, we investigated patterns in how superspreaders
                 are infected. Across trees with more than one superspreader,
                 we found support for the theory that superspreaders generate
                 other superspreaders, even when controlling for number of
                 secondary infections. In sum, our findings put the role of
                 superspreading to COVID-19 transmission in perspective with
                 that of SARS and MERS and suggest an avenue for further
                 research on the generation of superspreaders. These data have
                 been made openly available to encourage reuse and further
                 scientific inquiry.Author SummaryPublic health investigations
                 often aim to identify who infected whom, or the transmission
                 tree, during outbreaks of infectious diseases. These
                 investigations tend to be resource intensive but valuable as
                 they contain epidemiological information, including the
                 average number of infections caused by each individual and the
                 variation in this number. To date, there remains no
                 standardized format nor comprehensive database of infectious
                 disease transmission trees. To fill this gap, we standardized
                 and compiled more than 350 published transmission trees for 16
                 directly-transmitted diseases into a database that is publicly
                 available. In this paper, we give an overview of the database
                 construction process, as well as a demonstration of the types
                 of questions that the database can be used to answer related
                 to superspreader epidemiology. For example, we show that
                 COVID-19 outbreaks have fewer superspreaders than outbreaks of
                 SARS and MERS. We also find support for the theory that
                 superspreaders generate other superspreaders. In the future,
                 this database can be used to answer other outstanding
                 questions in the field of epidemiology.",

                   specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social
                   networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally
                   likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact
                   occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the
                   individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the
                   most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review
                   results from the theory of random directed graphs which show
                   that many important quantities, including the reproductive
                   number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the
                   joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (``risk'' and
                   ``spread''), including their heterogeneity and the
                   correlation between them. By considering joint distributions
                   of various kinds we elucidate why some types of
                   heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard
                   Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called
                   mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and
                   random, and some do not. We also show that some structured
                   SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types
                   of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of
                   Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from
                   the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some
                   possible policy implications of this directed structure,
                   both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions
                   designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular,
                   directed networks have a forward and backward version of the
                   classic ``friendship paradox'' -- forward links tend to lead
                   to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to
                   individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of
                   both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to
                   find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of
                   infection.",

              closures or social distancing by older people. Although we
              currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and

              levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios

              significantly increase the number of cases, unless this is
              accompanied by a change in adult behaviour. We also find that
              there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities

              evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary

              implemented to reduce transmission of severe acute respiratory
              syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK. Projecting the
              size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of
              different control measures has been crucial to support
              evidence-based policy making during the early stages of the
              epidemic. This study assesses the potential impact of different
              control measures for mitigating the burden of COVID-19 in the UK.
              METHODS: We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model
              to explore a range of intervention scenarios, tracking 66·4
              million people aggregated to 186 county-level administrative
              units in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The four
              base interventions modelled were school closures, physical
              distancing, shielding of people aged 70 years or older, and
              self-isolation of symptomatic cases. We also modelled the
              combination of these interventions, as well as a programme of
              intensive interventions with phased lockdown-type restrictions
              that substantially limited contacts outside of the home for
              repeated periods. We simulated different triggers for the
              introduction of interventions, and estimated the impact of
              varying adherence to interventions across counties. For each
              scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients
              requiring inpatient and critical care (ie, admission to the
              intensive care units [ICU]) treatment, and deaths, and compared
              the effect of each intervention on the basic reproduction number,
              R0. FINDINGS: We projected a median unmitigated burden of 23
              million (95\% prediction interval 13-30) clinical cases and 350
              000 deaths (170 000-480 000) due to COVID-19 in the UK by
              December, 2021. We found that the four base interventions were
              each likely to decrease R0, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU
              demand from exceeding health service capacity. The combined
              intervention was more effective at reducing R0, but only lockdown
              periods were sufficient to bring R0 near or below 1; the most
              stringent lockdown scenario resulted in a projected 120 000 cases
              (46 000-700 000) and 50 000 deaths (9300-160 000). Intensive
              interventions with lockdown periods would need to be in place for
              a large proportion of the coming year to prevent health-care
              demand exceeding availability. INTERPRETATION: The
              characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are
              probably required to bring the epidemic under control and to
              prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on
              hospital beds, especially those in ICUs. FUNDING: Medical

              the deterministic regime of an established epidemic, mathematical
              descriptions of the initial phase of epidemic growth are
              comparatively rarer. Here, we review existing mathematical

              the first detection time of an infected individual in an
              infection cluster depending on testing effort, and estimate that
              the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern Alpha detected in September

  abstract  = "In a Galton--Watson tree that is not extinct with at least two
               individuals alive in generation n pick two individuals at random
               by simple random sampling without replacement. Trace their lines
               of descent back in time till they meet. Call that generation X n
               . In this paper we present results on the exact distribution of
               X n and its limit as n goes to infinity for the single type
               discrete case. We consider four cases: explosive (mean
               infinity), supercritical, critical and subcritical. We apply
               these to study branching random walks. A number of open problems
               are listed at the end.This paper discusses multi-type
               $\Lambda$--coalescent processes which arise naturally from
               $\Lambda$--Fleming--Viot processes as dual processes back in
               time. Mutation and selection may be modelled as happening at
               random in the population, or in families at birth. The paper is
               a review of models developed in [4, 7].We consider a
               continuous-time branching random walk on a multidimensional
               lattice with finite variance of jumps and a finite set of the
               particle generation centers, i.e. branching sources. The main
               object of interest is the evolutionary operator for the mean
               number of particles both at an arbitrary point and on the entire
               lattice. It is shown that the amount of its positive
               eigenvalues, counting their multiplicity, does not exceed the
               amount of branching sources on the lattice, while the maximal of
               these eigenvalues is always simple. We present also an example
               demonstrating that the symmetry of the spatial configuration of
               sources can lead to appearance of multiple lower eigenvalues in
               the spectrum of the evolutionary operator.The results about
               branching structures within random walks will be surveyed at
               first. Then as an example of application, the stationary
               distribution of a birth-and-death process with bounded jumps
               will be calculated explicitly.Strongly critical branching
               processes with immigration (BPI) are investigated in varying
               environment (VE) when the time-varying offspring mean converges
               to 1 fast enough. Under natural assumptions a diffusion
               approximation is derived when either the offspring or the
               immigration variances are strictly positive. In the case of
               asymptotically vanishing offspring variances a fluctuation limit
               theorem is proved.This paper is a survey of some recent results
               on the asymptotics of the survival probability, limit theorems
               conditioned on survival or attaining a high level of single-type
               subcritical branching processes in independent and identically
               distributed random environments.The objective of this paper is
               to shed light on the implications of the Theorem of Envelopment
               of Societies in Resource Dependent Branching Processes (Bruss,
               Grenzen einer jeden Gesellschaft (in German; English summary).
               In: Jahresb. der Deut. Math.-Ver., vol. 116, pp. 137--152.
               Springer, Berlin, 2014; Bruss and Duerinckx, Ann. Appl. Probab.
               25(1):324--372, 2015), with respect to real world conclusions.
               At the same, our interest is to attract interest to resource
               dependent branching processes as a way to model complicated
               growth processes. The theorem of envelopment displays a
               macro-economic phenomenon: Every human population modelled by a
               resource dependent branching process will, for whatever way it
               chooses policies to distribute resources in different
               generations, in the long run be bound to fluctuate between two
               extreme society forms. Understanding a phenomenon does not imply
               that one can turn this into a useful tool. Indeed, we only know
               some situations so far where this theorem is directly applicable
               to obtain specific advice how societies should control policies
               to reach certain objectives. One way to a better understanding
               to more general cases is to find parallels with related known
               results. This is what we try to do here, very much instigated by
               the suggestion of Prof. K.B. Athreya to indicate links which are
               visible in contributions presented by colleagues.Classical
               branching processes, even the most general, share the property
               that individuals are supposed to multiply independently of one
               another, at least given some environment that in its turn is
               supposed to be unaffected by the population. Only more recently
               have birth-and-death and branching processes been considered
               which allow individual reproduction to be influenced by
               population size. The first results, due to Klebaner [14], deal
               with Galton-Watson processes. Work on general, age-structured
               processes and habitats with a threshold, a so called carrying
               capacity, came only decades later, cf. [5, 11, 13, 15, 16, 21],
               inspired by deterministic population dynamics [6--8,
               22].Sevastyanov (Theory Probab Appl 2:339--348, 1957) introduced
               a class of Markov branching processes in which immigration of
               individuals in the population is allowed at random time points
               described by a time-homogeneous Poisson process. In the present
               paper, we study a model generalized this process along two
               directions: Sevastyanov's (Theory Probab Appl 9:577--594, 1964)
               age-dependent branching process and time-nonhomogeneous Poisson
               immigration. The resulting process can be used to describe the
               dynamics of cell populations arising from differentiating stem
               cells. Limit theorems are proved in the supercritical case for
               various classes of immigration rates. Some of the limiting
               results offer generalizations of the classical result obtained
               in Sevastyanov (Theory Probab Appl 2:339--348, 1957). We also
               derive novel LLN and a CLT that arise from the fact that the
               process is time-inhomogeneous.The theory of Crump-Mode-Jagers
               branching processes gives us the expected future population as a
               solution of a renewal equation. In order to find the expected
               future population age structure a large amount of renewal
               equations must be solved. This paper presents a numerical
               approach for projecting the population age structure and solving
               these renewal equations based on the theory of General Branching
               Processes. It is shown that the Leslie matrix projection, widely
               used in demographics, is actually a special case of this method.
               Applying the continuous time theory of branching processes
               produces estimation error for the Leslie matrix projections that
               comes from discretization of time. The presented numerical
               method can also be used for solving renewal equations satisfying
               certain conditions of smoothness. It involves only simple matrix
               multiplications which results in a very fast calculation
               speed.The branching model considered in the present work is the
               controlled branching process. This model is a generalization of
               the standard Bienaym{\'e}-Galton-Watson (BGW) branching process,
               and, in the terminology of population dynamics, is used to
               describe the evolution of populations in which a control of the
               population size at each generation is needed. This control
               consists of determining mathematically the number of individuals
               with reproductive capacity at each generation through a random
               process. In practice, this branching model can describe
               reasonably well the probabilistic evolution of populations in
               which, for various reasons of an environmental, social, or other
               nature, there is a mechanism that establishes the number of
               progenitors which take part in each generation. For example, in
               an ecological context, one can think of an invasive animal
               species that is widely recognized as a threat to native
               ecosystems, but there is disagreement about plans to eradicate
               it, i.e., while the presence of the species is appreciated by a
               part of the society, if its numbers are left uncontrolled it is
               known to be very harmful to native ecosystems. In such a case,
               it is better to control the population to keep it within
               admissible limits even though this might mean periods when
               animals have to be culled. Another practical situation that can
               be modelled by this kind of process is the evolution of an
               animal population that is threatened by the existence of
               predators. In each generation, the survival of each animal (and
               therefore the possibility of giving new births) will be strongly
               affected by this factor, making the introduction of a random
               mechanism necessary to model the evolution of this kind of
               population.We consider stochastic processes (X n )n $\geq$ 0
               taking values in
               \textbackslash(\textbackslashmathbb\{R\}\_\{+\}^\{d\} =\{

               have a lot of applications in the real world. Basically, one
               counts the number of offspring or individuals in a certain
               generation. But that is only part of the story. In reality the
               mother (parents) passes some value to the children and they to
               their children and so on. Examples of values are the DNA
               sequence, money, knowledge, influence and so on.The
               linear-fractional Galton-Watson processes is a well known case
               when many characteristics of a branching process can be computed
               explicitly. In this paper we extend the two-parameter
               linear-fractional family to a much richer four-parameter family
               of reproduction laws. The corresponding Galton-Watson processes
               also allow for explicit calculations, now with possibility for
               infinite mean, or even infinite number of offspring. We study
               the properties of this special family of branching processes,
               and show, in particular, that in some explosive cases the time
               to explosion can be approximated by the Gumbel distribution.This
               paper is concerned with the use of vaccination schemes to
               control an epidemic in terms of the total number of individuals
               infected. In particular, monotonicity and continuity properties
               of total progeny of Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes are
               derived depending on vaccination level. Furthermore, optimal
               vaccination policies based on the mean and quantiles of the
               total number of infected individuals are proposed. Finally, how
               to apply the proposed methodology in real situations is shown
               through a simulated example motivated by an outbreak of
               influenza virus in humans, in Indonesia.This paper considers
               estimation of the within-household infection rate for a Markov
               SIR (susceptible $\rightarrow$ infective $\rightarrow$
               recovered) epidemic among a population that is partitioned into
               households, from data on the early exponentially growing phase
               of an epidemic. It is assumed that an estimate of the early
               exponential growth rate r of the epidemic is available, together
               with more detailed household-level data from a sample of
               households. A basic method, which uses the total size
               distribution of single-household epidemics, is usually biased
               owing to the emerging nature of an epidemic. An alternative
               method, which uses the asymptotic theory of continuous-time,
               multitype Markov branching processes to account for the emerging
               nature of an epidemic, is developed and shown by simulations to
               be feasible for realistic population sizes. A modified
               single-household epidemic process is used to show that the basic
               method is approximately unbiased when r is small.Some defective
               alleles of certain genes can cause severe diseases or serious
               disorders in the organisms that carry them. Some of these genes,
               as could be the responsible for hemophilia, are linked to X
               chromosome. If the alleles causing the disorder are dominant,
               all the carriers are affected and most of them do not reach
               breeding age so they are rarely detected in a population.
               However, recessive pernicious alleles can survive since they
               only affect to carrier males and homozygous carrier females (the
               last ones must be daughters of a carrier male, so they rarely
               exist). Hence, heterozygous carrier females are not affected but
               can pass the allele onto offspring. In this work, we introduce a
               multitype two-sex branching process for describing the evolution
               of the number of individuals carrying the alleles, R and r, of a
               gene linked to X chromosome. The R allele is considered dominant
               and the r allele is supposed to be recessive and defective,
               responsible of a disorder. In this model we study the fate of
               the recessive allele in the population, i.e. under which
               conditions it eventually disappears. We also investigate
               conditions for the fixation of the dominant allele and the
               extinction of the population. Finally, conditions for the
               coexistence of both alleles are conjectured and their proofs are
               proposed as open problems.This work deals with stochastic
               modeling in biological populations. We develop a two-sex
               branching process as an appropriate mathematical model to
               describe the demographic dynamics of biological populations with
               sexual reproduction. We assume several mating and reproduction
               strategies. Moreover, unlike other classes of two-sex branching
               processes where mating and reproduction are influenced by the
               number of couples in the population, we now consider the most
               realistic case where both (mating and reproduction) are affected
               by the numbers of females and males in the population. We study
               the extinction/survival of populations modeled by such two-sex
               branching process.The main goal of this paper is to consider
               branching processes with two types and in continuous time to
               model the dynamics of the number of different types of cells,
               which due to a small reproductive ratio are fated to become
               extinct. However, mutations occurring during the reproduction
               process may lead to the appearance of a new type of cells that
               may escape extinction. This is a typical real world situation
               with the emergence of scatters after local eradication of a
               certain type of cancer during the chemotherapy. Mathematically,
               we are deriving the numbers of mutations of the escape type and
               their moments. A cell of the ``mutation'' type, which leads
               possibly to the beginning of a lineage, that will allow
               indefinite survival is called ``successful mutant''. Using the
               results about the probability generating function of the
               single-type branching processes, an answer about the
               distribution of the waiting time to produce a ``successful
               mutant'' in continuous-time setting is obtained. In general, our
               results aim to prove the limits of expanding the methods used by
               Serra and Haccou (Theor. Popul. Biol. 72:167--178, 2007) for
               different schemes leading to mutation.",

              significant heterogeneities in the transmission of communicable

              process that allows for these heterogeneities is used to
              demonstrate the potentially considerable effect that
              heterogeneity of transmission will have on epidemic outbreak size

  abstract    = "AbstractSARS-CoV-2 is a human pathogen that causes infection
                 in both the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the lower
                 respiratory tract (LRT). The viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2
                 infection and how they relate to infectiousness and disease
                 progression are not well understood. Here, we develop
                 data-driven viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
                 both the URT and LRT. We fit the models to viral load data
                 from patients with likely infection dates known, we estimated
                 that infected individuals with a longer incubation period had
                 lower rates of viral growth, took longer to reach peak viremia
                 in the URT, and had higher chances of presymptomatic
                 transmission. We then developed a model linking viral load to
                 infectiousness. We found that to explain the substantial
                 fraction of transmissions occurring presymptomatically, a
                 person's infectiousness should depend on a saturating function
                 of the viral load, making the logarithm of the URT viral load
                 a better surrogate of infectiousness than the viral load
                 itself. Comparing the roles of target-cell limitation, the
                 innate immune response, proliferation of target cells and
                 spatial infection in the LRT, we found that spatial
                 dissemination in the lungs is likely to be an important
                 process in sustaining the prolonged high viral loads. Overall,
                 our models provide a quantitative framework for predicting how
                 SARS-CoV-2 within-host dynamics determine infectiousness and
                 represent a step towards quantifying how viral load dynamics
                 and the immune responses determine disease
                 severity.SignificanceA quantitative understanding of the
                 kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection is key to understanding the
                 development of infectiousness and disease symptoms. To address
                 this need, we developed data-driven within-host models of
                 SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed that lower rates of viral
                 growth lead to longer incubation periods and higher chances of
                 presymptomatic transmission. We found that the logarithm of
                 the URT viral load serves an appropriate surrogate for a
                 person's infectiousness. We then developed a mechanistic model
                 for infectiousness and showed that a saturation effect in the
                 dependence of transmission on viral load gives rise to this
                 relationship. We also provide evidence of spatial
                 dissemination in the lungs as an important process in
                 sustaining prolonged high viral loads in the LRT.",

              viral RNA shedding. The dynamics of viral RNA concentration,
              particularly in the early stages of infection, can inform
              clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening.
              We used prospective longitudinal quantitative reverse
              transcription PCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories
              for 68 individuals during the resumption of the 2019-2020
              National Basketball Association season. For 46 individuals with
              acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and
              the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases.
              According to our mathematical model, we found that viral RNA
              concentrations peaked an average of 3.3 days (95\% credible
              interval [CI] 2.5, 4.2) after first possible detectability at a
              cycle threshold value of 22.3 (95\% CI 20.5, 23.9). The viral
              clearance phase lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.9
              days [95\% CI 7.9, 14.4]) than for asymptomatic individuals (7.8
              days [95\% CI 6.1, 9.7]). A second test within 2 days after an
              initial positive PCR test substantially improves certainty about
              a patient's infection stage. The effective sensitivity of a test
              intended to identify infectious individuals declines
              substantially with test turnaround time. These findings indicate
              that SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations peak rapidly regardless of
